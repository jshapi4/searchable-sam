        The State Administrative Manual (SAM) is a resource for statewide
        policies, procedures, requirements and information developed and issued
        by authoring agencies which include the Governor's Office (GO),
        Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Human Resources (CalHR),
        Department of General Services (DGS), and the California Department of
        Technology (CDT).
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to provide a uniform approach to statewide management policy,
        the contents are published under the authority of the Directors of DOF
        and DGS. SAM is administered by the DGS Office of Training and
        Administrative Standards (OTAS), Policy Unit.
