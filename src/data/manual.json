        "title": "Statewide Telework Policy",
        "content": "Intended Audience\n\nThis policy applies to all state of California agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and offices (departments). Departments are responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of this policy.\n\nOverview\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide the structure needed for effective telework programs to benefit the state of California and its employees. Each department shall establish a written policy specific to the department’s business needs in accordance with this statewide policy. Departments shall establish uniform expectations for performance management and for communication within distributed teams as a foundation for a successful telework program.\n\nThe terms ‘telework,’ ‘teleworking,’ and ‘telecommuting’ refer to work flexibility arrangements established between the department management and the employee where the employee performs the duties and responsibilities of their position from a location other than the office.\n\nNote: Definitions for terms are at the end of the policy.\n\nGoals\n\nAn effective telework program must provide a benefit to the state, as well as employees, and should generate savings or at least be cost neutral. Department's telework programs are expected to:\n\nEncourage participation of eligible employees Reduce required state office space Improve employee retention and recruitment Maintain or improve employee productivity Reduce state environmental impacts, such as traffic congestion Maintain or improve customer service\n\nAuthority\n\nThe statewide telework program is established pursuant to Government Code sections 14200-14203 . Existing law requires every state department to incorporate telecommuting as a work option.\n\nFor bargaining units (BUs) with an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), if the MOU contains telework language that is in conflict with this policy, the MOU language shall be controlling.\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\nDepartment Management shall:\n\nEnsure that teleworking arrangements conform with applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, and collective bargaining agreements. Compensate telework employees in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies, including the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ). Evaluate employee performance in accordance with existing performance management laws, rules, regulations, policies, standards, expectations, and measures.\n\nDepartments should incorporate telework into their continuity of operations plans.\n\nPolicy Directives\n\nDepartments shall:\n\nEstablish or revise their telework program and supporting policy within twelve months of the issuance of Management Memo 21-08 for compliance. The policy shall include: The applicable criteria for an employee’s participation in the department’s telework program. Not all positions or job classifications may be appropriate for telework arrangements and departments have the discretion to determine an employee’s participation in telework. All employees in positions designated by management as eligible shall be qualified to participate in telework and are authorized to participate to the fullest extent possible without diminished individual or organizational performance. The process of how employees will be notified of their eligibility and approval for telework consistent with bargaining unit agreements. The financial responsibility of the department with respect to telework program costs. The technology and security responsibilities of the department and the employee including setting forth appropriate measures to protect confidential information, for both electronic and paper records, that may be taken from the office to alternate work locations. Expectations to supervisors/managers on advising employees that they will continue to be assessed using existing performance standards, expectations, and measures. Clear communication that teleworking employees will be eligible for the same opportunities as employees not participating in telework, including assignments, development opportunities, promotions, and awards/recognition. Information on the procedure to request modification or termination of telework agreement. The goals of the department’s telework program in addition to the statewide policy goals. The telework program shall: Consider telework for all possible positions in which telework can promote effective and efficient business operations. The following guidance may be used to determine what functions may be appropriate for telework: Activities that do not require physical presence, including, but not limited to, analysis, data entry, telephoning, writing and editing, design and virtual service delivery. Responsibilities that do not require public presence. Activities where data is not sensitive or confidential or where an information security risk assessment and resulting security approach is in place for telework access to sensitive or confidential data. Consider at a minimum the following factors when determining which positions may be eligible for a telework arrangement: Nature of work performed. Efficiency of work processes. Effectiveness of existing project teams. Impact on ability to provide quality customer service. Utilization of office space or space savings. Technology readiness of department such as equipment, infrastructure, and support. Impact to employee retention. Establish a Telework Coordinator. Designate a department Telework Coordinator who will be responsible for the following: Retaining approved Telework Agreement forms for each employee. Reviewing Telework Agreements for compliance with telework program. Serving as primary point of contact for employees who have questions or concerns about the telework program. Developing or assisting with departmental policy, guidelines, and implementation. Serving as an advisor for department leadership regarding telework. Serving as a resource for supervisors with telework issues and concerns. Assisting with completion and reporting of metrics to ascertain effectiveness of telework program. Serving as point of contact for the Department of General Services regarding telework program and its effectiveness.

Standards and expectations for communication and collaboration tools. Security requirements for state-owned and for employee-owned computing devices (if allowing teleworkers to use them). Physical and electronic data protection. Asset Management. Document the arrangement with each teleworking employee utilizing the Telework Agreement form (Standard Form 200 – Telework Agreement). The Telework Agreement provides the framework for the general expectations between management and the employee. The Telework Agreement must be completed and acknowledged by both parties prior to implementation. In order to ensure standard application across all departments, departments may not modify the form. Departments may choose to recreate the form electronically to aid with workflow and/or data collection. Ensure methods are established for performance management for all staff eligible to work. Prohibit ongoing informal telework arrangements. Incidental telework may be permitted at the department’s discretion. Emergency telework arrangements due to unforeseen circumstances may be entered into at the department’s discretion. Implement a standard process to allow employees to check out state-issued equipment for telework use, including computer equipment required for the job and ergonomic equipment. Have a process to reliably track state-owned assets before allowing employees to check out equipment. Ensure that appropriate security measures have been taken, including encryption of any storage devices or media. Designate teleworkers as either Remote-centered or Office-centered. A teleworker is considered Remote-centered if they work fifty percent or more of their time from an alternate work location. A teleworker is considered Office-centered if they work more than fifty percent from the office. Optimize the use of state office resources by providing equipment for a single dedicated workstation for teleworking employees. Remote-centered teleworkers shall have their dedicated work station at their designated alternate work location. Remote-centered teleworkers shall use a shared workstation when working in the office. Office-centered teleworkers shall have a dedicated work station in the office and utilize their own equipment or department provided mobile equipment for teleworking at their designated alternate work location.

Review employee Telework Agreements at least annually to ensure the agreement continues to meet business needs. Retain the authority to disapprove an employee’s selection of a particular alternate work location if management determines the location is not business appropriate. Treat teleworking employees the same as an employee working in the office with respect to performance management, conduct, training, and promotional opportunities. Revise or cancel an employee’s Telework Agreement, if it is determined by management that: The telework arrangement results in a reduction in performance, does not enable training, oversight, or any other supervision deemed necessary. The agreement no longer supports operational needs due to funding or services being shifted. Endeavor to provide 30 days’ notice to the employee in the event of a revision or termination of a Telework Agreement.\n\nEmployees shall:\n\nBe responsible for maintaining their workstation at their alternate work location and for maintaining and returning equipment as outlined in the Telework Agreement. Ensure that alternate work location is free from distractions. Secure needed internet service prior to the start of a telework arrangement. Observe departmental policy for overtime. Overtime compensation shall be consistent with the department’s overtime policy. A Telework Agreement does not amend compensation or time reporting requirements. Use state-owned hardware, software, internet, email, and other forms of state-owned communication media in a manner consistent with the state’s information security and privacy policies and standards that are prescribed in the State Administrative Manual (SAM) Chapter 5300 and the corresponding State Information Management Manual (SIMM). Agree to follow their department’s Acceptable Use Policy. Complete their annual Information Security and Privacy Awareness training. Ensure dependent care and other personal responsibilities do not adversely affect an employee’s normal work duties or professionalism. Participate in all studies, inquiries, reports, and analyses relating to the telework program.\n\nEquipment Cost\n\nThe employee can use their own equipment, including their own computing device, with departmental approval. Where an employee is not providing their own equipment, the department shall provide appropriate equipment for a single dedicated work station required to perform job functions including:\n\nComputing equipment. Telephone service. If an employee needs a work number, they should be provided a single phone number that can be used at an alternate work location and office location. Ergonomic equipment as appropriate per department’s ergonomic policy such as chair, sit/stand device, or headset. Office supplies such as paper, pens, etc. Delivery of items that are not easily moved to the work station at the alternate work location.\n\nBusiness expenses shall be evaluated in accordance with existing applicable policies, laws and standards. Other business expenses may include, but are not limited to, printers, scanners, and other office supplies.\n\nMaintenance of state-owned equipment is managed the same as in the office.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\nDGS will survey departments to measure the results of adopting telework programs. Departments shall provide reporting to DGS no later than twelve months from the issuance of Management Memo 21-08. At a minimum, departments shall report:\n\nNumber of employees eligible to participate. Number of employees participating in telework. Average number of days teleworking per employee. Office space saved as a result of teleworking. Additional costs and/or savings associated with implementation of telework. Number of shared work stations. Measures used to determine productivity. Reduction in vehicle commute miles traveled.\n\nLiability\n\nThe alternate work location is an extension of the department’s workplace only when used for work. All existing workplace health and safety rules, as well as all existing employment laws, rules, and policies, apply the same as they would for staff reporting to the office.\n\nThe state of California is not responsible for any injuries to family members, visitors, or other guests at the employee’s alternate work location. The teleworking employee shall not have any business guests at a residence designated as an alternate work location.\n\nThe teleworking employee is solely responsible for any tax implications and insurance requirements, and compliance with state and local laws and ordinances when the alternate work location is a residence.\n\nDefinitions\n\nRemote-centered telework: A teleworker is considered Remote-centered if they work fifty percent or more of their time from an alternate work location. Remote-centered teleworkers shall have their dedicated work station located at their designated alternate work location. Remote-centered teleworkers shall use shared space when working in the office.\n\nOffice-centered telework: A teleworker is considered Office-centered if they work more than fifty percent from the office.

        "content": "This chapter provides guidelines on traveling for official State of California (State) business and for obtaining reimbursements. Travel expenses are reimbursed in accordance with the policies found within the California Code of Regulations, Title 2 (Administration), Division 1 (Administrative Personnel), Chapter 3 (Department of Human Resources), Subchapter 1 (General Civil Service Rules), Article 2 (Travel Expenses) , employee Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), and the CalHR Online HR Manual (section 2200).\n\nBasic Policies\n\nUse travel when personal contact is the most economical way of conducting official State business. Limit attendance at conferences and meetings to those directly concerned with the topic. Use the most economical method of transportation. Consider the time employees will be away from the office and the direct cost of the methods that may be used. Avoid backtracking and duplicate travel whenever possible. State vehicles should not be parked overnight at an airport unless there is no other practical and reasonable way for the employee to get to and from the airport. Travel should be done in the most efficient and least costly manner. An employee may use a more costly form of transportation, but they may be paid at the less costly rate. In such cases a cost-comparison must be done to determine the least costly rate."

        "content": "(For further clarification of the following terms and definitions, see CALHR Rule 599.616 or CALHR Rule 599.616.1 ).\n\nBusiness and Miscellaneous Expenses. These are costs necessary for completion of State business. Some examples are: phone calls, telegrams, emergency clothing, equipment, and supply purchase.\n\nBusiness-Related Meals. These are meals taken in combination with business meetings when business cannot be done at any other time.\n\nHeadquarters. This is where employees spend the largest part of their regular working time, or where the employee returns upon completion of a special assignment, or a specifically assigned geographic area regularly traveled.\n\nIn-State Travel and Travel in Bordering States. Travel within state boundaries and through areas next to state borders is in-state travel. The bordering state travel must be incidental to the in-state trip to be in-state travel.\n\nIncidentals. The State reimburses an employee (when the travel period is greater than 24 hours) for small miscellaneous expenses while traveling. Examples include: laundry and dry cleaning, newspapers and magazines, tips, etc.\n\nOut-of-State Travel. This includes travel to and from a point outside California to transact official State business. It does not include trips through or stopovers in bordering states incidental to travel within points in California.\n\nPer Diem Expenses. These expenses are charges for meals and lodging while traveling.\n\nPrimary/Permanent Residence. This is the dwelling where the employee lives, which bears the most logical relationship to the employee's headquarters, regardless of other legal or mailing addresses. If an employee maintains more than one dwelling, the department will designate the employee's primary/permanent residence.\n\nSecondary Residence. When an employee maintains more than one dwelling that meets the criteria in CALHR Rules 599.616(b) or 599.616.1(b), these are secondary residence(s).\n\nState Vehicles (Pool Vehicles). A fleet of vehicles maintained by the Department of General Services or other agencies for use by State agencies in the conduct of their business.\n\nTransient Occupancy Tax. A tax imposed by cities and counties within the State. The tax varies from 6% to 12% (depending on location). This tax may be waived (and your lodging rate reduced) if you show proof that you are a State employee on official State business. The waiver is always at the option of the lodging establishment. See Travel Guide Supplement for a sample Tax Waiver Form.\n\nTransportation Expenses. These expenses are the charges to transport the employee to and from the employee's headquarters. Some examples are: charges for commercial carriers (e.g., airline, bus, rental vehicle, etc.), private vehicle mileage, parking costs, bridge and road tolls.\n\nTravel Expenses. Travel expenses include per diem expenses, transportation expenses, and business and miscellaneous expenses."

CALHR PML 93-28 delegated to agencies/departments the authority to approve exceptions to the “50 mile rule” when certain criteria are met. Certain reimbursements which are made under the provisions of PML 93-28 may be deemed reportable income. Contact your departments’ accounting office for clarification on this issue. Lodging costs associated with regular travel, and conferences/conventions are in excess of the approved State rates found within CALHR Rules 599.619(a), 599.621(a), and the MOU. Exception requests must be submitted and approved on an Excess Lodging Rate Request form ( STD 255C ) , found here http://www.documents.dgs.ca.gov/dgs/fmc/pdf/std255C.pdf, prior to the trip taking place.

No lunch or incidental allowance is paid when employees are on travel status for less than 24 hours. Expenses must be incurred at least 50 miles from headquarters. This distance from the headquarters is the normal commute distance determined by the most direct route. Sometimes one route of travel may be a greater distance but is the more reasonable commute. For example, taking a freeway route instead of congested surface streets is more reasonable. The freeway miles may be greater but because it is more efficient the freeway miles are used to determine the distance.\n\nLodging and Meal Allowance Reimbursements\n\nThe following defines conditions for payment.\n\nIn-State Lodging/Meal Allowance. Per diem and lodging expenses will be reimbursed in the amount of actual expenses, supported by a receipt, up to the maximum rates as identified in the CALHR Rules and current applicable MOU. Each item of expense of $25.00 or more requires a receipt; receipts may be required for items of expense that are less than $25.00. Out-of-State Lodging/Meal Allowance. Reimbursement is made for actual lodging expense, supported by a receipt. Meals and incidentals will be reimbursed at in- State rates. Failure to furnish lodging receipts will limit reimbursement to meals and incidentals at the in-State rates. Out-of-Country Lodging/Meal Allowance. Reimbursement will be made for actual lodging, supported by a receipt. Meals/incidentals will be reimbursed according to the Maximun Per Diem Allowances for Foreign Areas, Section 925 , U.S. Department of State Standardized Regulations and the meal/incidental breakdown in Federal Travel Regulation Chapter 301, Travel Allowances, Appendix B.\n\nEmployees who receive a meal as part of State travel must reduce their per diem claim by the cost for that meal.

Any state, independent, or local agency applying or planning to apply for federal funds should contact the SCH or consult OPR’s website ( Governor's office of Planning and Research - federal grant review page ) to determine if that their Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number (CFDA Number) is one of the grants subjected to state review. The SCH requires that a federal Standard Form 424 (the front application cover page) be submitted to SCH and their appropriate Area wide Clearinghouse at least 30 to 60 days prior to the final deadline set by the federal agency. The SCH does not set nor know the final deadlines for grants and will accept a federal Standard Form 424 at any time. The applicant is responsible for submitting their grant application in sufficient time to meet all deadlines. State agencies and departments who apply for federal funds are responsible for including a provision for recovery of indirect costs as described in Government Code sections 13332.01 and 13332.02 and reiterated in SAM section 8755.1. In addition, the SCH does not have information on federally funded grants. Information can be obtained by calling the federal agency funding the grant or by looking in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SCH will send a letter to the applicant at the end of the review period. If the SCH does not receive comments on a grant, the review will close 30 days after submittal. If comments are received, then the review period will close 60 days after submittal. All grant applications are sent out for review in the State Clearinghouse Newsletter.Federal agencies who require this letter will contact the SCH. The SCH does not deal with form CA-189, only the federal Standard Form 424 and those grants mandated for review by E.O. 12372. General Review. Once a federal Standard Form 424 (see Appendix C) has been submitted to the SCH and assigned a number, it is put out for review in the State Clearinghouse Newsletter. This newsletter is sent to all state agencies, area clearinghouses, local libraries, university libraries, and private citizens (at their request). The SCH requires that a federal Standard Form 424 (usually the front application cover page) be submitted at least 30 to 60 days prior to the final deadline set by the federal agency. If the SCH does not receive comments on a grant, the review will close 30 days after submittal. If comments are received, then the review period will close 60 days after submittal. All comments will be forwarded to the applicant. This review process is standard for all grants that are listed under E.O. 12372. A grant that does not fall under the E.O. 12372 should not be submitted to the SCH. Not all federally funded grants fall under E.O. 12372 for state review.

This Chapter applies to all agencies, including those designated as a single State agency for receipt of Federal funds. Objective. State plans should present a clearly defined, uniform policy that directs all State administered programs. The planning process described below is not meant to duplicate or replace the coordination between departments that is normally achieved at the Cabinet level. The objective of this process is to promote: State policies that guide spending. Uniform programs and policies in areas that affect more than one agency. The use of the same population projections and demographic data that is provided by the State's Demographic Research Unit. Oversight in the use of Federal funds. Consultation between agencies when the programs of one agency may impact the programs of other agencies. Uniform policies when more than one agency serves the same client group. Interaction between agencies with similar programs where there is the possibility that they can help one another deliver services. The avoidance of duplicated effort among State agencies. The receipt of Federal funds. The use of Federal funds to achieve State policies while avoiding increased State expenditures. The use of Federal funds and regulations in keeping with State policies. Human and social services that prevent dependence on public assistance, and foster self-sufficiency and independence whenever possible. Providing the Department of Finance ( DOF ) with timely planning and program data. This will help Finance better evaluate the cost-effectiveness of State planning programs. Providing the Office of Planning and Research ( OPR ) with timely planning and program data. This will help OPR better evaluate the effectiveness, coordination, and consistency of State planning programs in meeting Statewide goals and objectives.\n\nProcedure . All State agencies that are required by legislative or executive mandate to prepare a State plan must comply with the planning process review procedures described below. The State plan does not need to be statewide in scope. If more than one plan is prepared to fulfill State or Federal requirements, then each plan is subject to the review process.\n\nAll State agencies that prepare a State plan must:\n\nSubmit an Early Notice of Plan Preparation to the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) by February 1 of the year that the plan is prepared. Participate in an early consultation meeting sponsored by OPR. The meeting is held to discuss the concerns and recommendations of agencies, and interested parties regarding the proposed plan.

Human resources. Education Code Section 56881 requires OPR to \"establish procedures for the development and review of State agency plans\" that use Federal funds for programs that may serve handicapped children. The purposes of the review are to assure coordination of programs serving handicapped children and to secure all available Federal funding.

The exact number needed is set by OPR based on response to the Early Notice of Plan Preparation. OPR must get its copies at least 45 days before the final plan is presented to the approving or funding Federal or State organization. OPR sends copies of the draft State plan to consulting agencies. These agencies are asked to review the plan. They are also asked to comment on how well it reflects the recommendations and comments made during the early consultation meeting. OPR performs a similar analysis. OPR sends the preparing agency the written comments and recommendations, including OPR's own, on the draft State plan within 30 days after they are received from the last responding agency. If the comments warrant, OPR will set up a meeting between the preparing and consulting agencies, or itself. The meeting is scheduled during the 30-day draft plan review period. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss changes to the plan. Any unresolved issues to be followed up in next year's planning process are also discussed. STEPS TO PLANNING PROCESS (Revised 2/93) OPR sends a copy of the comments to the responsible Cabinet level agency for the department preparing the plan with a copy of the comments. When appropriate, OPR also provides issues of an interdepartmental nature for agency or Cabinet level resolution. When plans fall within the E.O. 12372 process, OPR sends a letter to the preparing agency when the review requirements are complete. The preparing agency sends OPR at least two copies of the final plan. One copy goes to the State Library and one copy goes to each of the consulting agencies. OPR recognizes that delays in finalizing Federal regulations can reduce the time available to prepare State plans. For this reason, the early consultation meeting can occur before Federal regulations are finalized. When regulations are delayed, OPR's State Plan Coordinator should be contacted to work out a new time schedule. Any of the steps listed above may be changed by mutual agreement of OPR and the preparing agency. Time periods can be lengthened or shortened. Change is done on a case-by-case basis. Modification of the process is based on: The time needed to ensure proper interagency consultation. The interest stated by other consulting agencies. Shortened Federal time lines."

        "content": "The objectives of interdepartmental consultation are:\n\nTo find ways of solving the problems of two or more agencies either through a single program or by working together. To get more done than is possible if involved agencies remain unaware of each other's common interests.\n\nAgencies can easily work together when they have a good understanding of how related programs work. To make State plans usable by other agencies, basic information is needed to make consultation worthwhile. This basic information helps area wide Clearinghouses perform E.O. 12372 reviews of State plans.\n\nThere is no special format for exchanging basic information. This allows the preparing agency the flexibility to meet other State and Federal information provisions. Basic information should describe:\n\nEligibility for Services—Target Groups . Give income guidelines, eligibility for related services, age ranges, target groups and targeted community characteristics, if any (urban, rural, etc.).\n\nRole of Local Agencies in Program Administration and Service Delivery . Note the role of welfare departments, community-based agencies, community action agencies, local offices of State agencies, and others.\n\nSources of Program Funding . Give totals for Federal, State, local, and private sources. Include reimbursement amounts and typical rates.\n\nSimilar Complementary Services . Briefly describe similar services. These might be programs run by other State, Federal, or local agencies, or by independent agencies like United Way affiliates or CHAD. Include a brief description of complementary services. These might be programs offered within an agency on which plan related services are dependent."

Anyone who signs a purchase document should have knowledge in the procurement laws, policies, and procedures pertaining to the goods or services being procured. If an individual with signature authority does not possess sufficient procurement knowledge and expertise, the individual should, prior to signing, have the purchase document reviewed by someone who possesses such knowledge and expertise. Delegation of signature authority is a selective process and should be commensurate with experience with principles of sound contracting and procurement policies, demonstrated familiarity with the process of purchase document formation, execution, and administration, and completion of applicable training and/or certifications. Each executive officer who has statutory authority to sign purchase documents shall ensure that his/her agency maintains a current written record of agency employees authorized to enter into and sign purchase documents on behalf of that agency.This written record shall be subject to DGS audit. State Board’s and Commission’s purchase documents in excess of $5,000 must be accompanied by a copy of the resolution approving the execution of the purchase document, unless by statute the executive officer may sign the purchase document. Local Governmental Entities–Authority Purchase documents to be signed by a county, city, district or other local public body must be authorized by a resolution, order, motion or ordinance for the purchase document. A copy of the authorization should be sent to DGS/OLS with the purchase document.

The law requires all contracts to be approved by DGS unless exempted or there is a delegation to an agency. All contracts and interagency agreements (I/A) are subject to approval by DGS except: a. Contracts of $50,000 or less, unless subject to the provisions of SAM Section 1216 . See Government Code (GC) Section (§) 14616 . b. Contracts with specific statutory exemption from DGS approval. See Public Contract Code (PCC) § 10295 . c. Amendment to a contract or I/A that only extends the time for completion of performance for a period of one year or less. A contract may only be amended once under this exemption. See PCC § 10335 . d. Any contract for which the agency has a specific exemption letter from DGS under GC § 14616 , or PCC § 10351 . e. It is an I/A over $50,000 and less than $1,000,000 that uses the current GIAs (including SAM 8752 and 8752.1 cost provisions) without modification and that has no direct or indirect subcontracting (GC § 11256 ), subject also to the following: This I/A exemption does not apply when contracting with CSU, UC, or any other state agency that is a exempt from Division 2, Part 2 Chapter 2 of the Public Contract Code (PCC § 10290 et seq.); Agencies shall not use I/As to circumvent any state law or contracting requirements; Agencies shall not use I/As to obtain any third-party IT goods or services nor any third-party non-IT goods or services; DGS reserves the right to audit exempt contracts at the contracting agency’s expense; If DGS determines an agency is failing to abide by the conditions of this exemption, DGS reserves the right to revoke the exemption such that that agency would then be required to submit to DGS for approval all I/As of $5,000 or more (or such other amount as DGS establishes when revoking or reducing this exemption); DGS is establishing this I/A exemption on a pilot basis, and DGS will evaluate outcomes to determine whether to modify, continue, or discontinue the exemption.\n\nAlthough these contracts do not require DGS/OLS approval, review/approval services are available on request for any contract, regardless of value.\n\n4. Considerations Related to Exempt Contracts\n\na. No contract which exceeds $75,000 will be exempt from DGS review, without specific statutory authority. b. A copy of each exempt contract or I/A is to be retained in the agency’s file for three years from the date of the final payment. c. Where the performance is other than monetary, such consideration must be valued on a monetary basis for the purpose of determining whether approval of DGS is required. d. Any state agency that enters into or expects to enter into more than one consulting services contract with the same individual, business firm, or corporation within a 12-month period for an aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more, shall notify DGS in writing and shall have each contract that exceeds an aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) approved by DGS. e. Splitting of contracts to avoid any monetary limitations is prohibited. If it is found that more than one contract has been awarded to a single contractor in any one year for work normally considered one undertaking, and the total of the contracts exceeds $4,999, the agency may be denied the exemptions from DGS approval as granted in this and other sections of SAM. f. Revenue and reimbursable contracts are to be submitted to DGS under the same dollar categories as other contracts. g. Master agreements are to be submitted to DGS regardless of the dollar amount. Contracts or subscription agreements pursuant to a master agreement are to be submitted to DGS under the same dollar categories as other contracts."

        "content": "Competitive bidding is required unless there is a legally authorized basis for bid exemption. Key exemption categories are identified below. A. Statutory Exemptions 1. Contracts of less than $5,000 ( PCC §§ 10335(a), 10335.5(c)(5) ). 2. Contracts of less than $5,000 where only per diem or travel expenses, or a combination thereof, are to be paid ( PCC § 10335(a) ). 3. Emergency contracts. The work or service is for the immediate preservation of the public health, welfare, safety, or protection of state property ( PCC § 1102, 10340 ). 4. Interagency agreements. Contracts with other California state agencies, and California State University and University of California campuses (PCC §§ 10335(a) , 10340(b)(3) ; GC § 11256 ; see also SCM 1, section 3.03 .). 5. Contracts with other public entities, including contracts with another state, local, or federal agency, auxiliaries of CSU or the California community colleges; or an organization acting as a governmental agency under a joint powers agreement (PCC §§ 10335(a) , 10340(b)(3) ; see also SCM 1, section 3.06.A ). 6.

Note: Contracts with CRPs that are justified under GC § 19130 (a) are required to be competitively bid. 9. Small Business/Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise (SB/DVBE) Option (GC § 14838.5 ; PCC §§ 10335.5(c)(6) , 10340(b)(6) ). a. This option allows for an award under the following conditions: 1) The contract is awarded to a certified SB, micro-business or DVBE; 2) The contract award is greater than $5,000 and less than $250,000; and 3) Quotes were received from at least two certified SBs or micro-businesses; or two certified DVBEs. b. An award based on receiving only one quote is not permitted under this method. c. Mixing quotes (e.g. one SB and one DVBE) is not permitted under this method. d. The code does not expressly require award to the low quote, however, if award will be made by other than low quote, the agency must document the business reasons and cost reasonableness basis for selecting the other quote. e. No particular format or timing is required under this option. Agencies have discretion as to how to obtain the quotes. Agencies should provide vendors sufficient information about the services on which the vendors can formulate a quote, including copy of the proposed contract (e.g. scope, payment provisions, and terms). f. The SB preference is not applicable under this method. g. There is no protest right for this method. (GC § 14838.5 ) Therefore agencies should not cite protest provisions when soliciting quotes. h. Use of this method is capped at $250,000 for the entire contract term, including any option years and/or amendments. If an agency believes the contract may exceed $250,000, they should use a different solicitation method, such as an IFB or RFP. If quotes come in over $250,000, the agency would need to resolicit, either scaling down the project to lower the quotes or using a different solicitation method. i. For public works, the dollar range for which this two-quote method can be used is $5,000 to $270,000 (or other project cost limit amount as may periodically be issued by the Director of Finance pursuant to PCC § 10105 ) (GC § 14838.7 ). 10.

Executive Order on NCB The Governor’s Executive Order, D-02-55, issued effective May 20, 2002, rescinded the previous sole source Executive Order W-103-94 and all management memos related to that Executive Order. c. The NCB form with instructions and signature requirements can be found on the DGS/PD website. See also SCM volume 2 ( SCM 2 ). d. An SCR is similar to an NCB but involves a group of related contracts rather than a single contract. The SCR form and further information can also be found on the DGS/Procurement Division website and in SCM 2 . 2. DGS Categorical Exemptions (PCC § 10348 ; historical references: SAM Section 1233, Management Memo (MM) 03-10). a. Services contracts using a DGS Leverage Purchase Agreement; b. Subvention and local assistance contracts as defined in SCM 1 , section 3.17. This exception applies only when services are provided to the public and not specifically to a state agency; c.

Contracts where the state is unable to compete and select a different contractor because a contractor has already been selected by a federal, state, city, county, or other regulatory entity to perform a service in a specific geographical area (e.g., refuse and/or sewage disposal contracts where there is an exclusive franchise agreement that has no exception for the state); e. Public entertainment contracts for state-sponsored fairs and expositions; f. Contracts that can only be performed by a public entity as defined in Unemployment Insurance Code Section 605(b); g. Contracts for conference or meeting facilities, including room accommodations for conference attendees, not to exceed $250,000; h.

Contracts for emergency room hospitals, and medical groups, physicians, and ancillary staff providing services at emergency room hospitals, when a patient is transported to a designated emergency room hospital for the immediate preservation of life and limb and there is no competition because the emergency room hospital is designated by a local emergency medical services agency and medical staffing is designated by the hospital. This exemption covers only those services provided in response to the emergency room transport; (historical reference: MM 05-04.) j. Contracts with health maintenance organizations (HMOs) through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to pay monthly premium payments for medical/Medicare eligible members, where services are essential or necessary for health and safety; k. Proprietary subscriptions, proprietary publications and/or technical manuals regardless of media format, up to $250,000. This includes access to pre-existing proprietary research data through a non-IT services contract, however “subscription” is not intended to include the performance of any personal services (such as, but not limited to, consulting, advice, research); l. Rental of proprietary postage meters if they are interfaced and intermembered with existing mailing equipment and there is only one authorized manufacturer’s branch or qualified dealer representative providing services for a manufacturer in a specified geographical area. This exemption applies only in circumstances where annual postage meter rental services are less than $100,000; m. Departmental memberships in professional organizations provided it is solely a membership and does not include the performance of any personal services. Note: Memberships for represented employees are governed by applicable collective bargaining agreements and memberships for non-represented employees are governed by CalHR rules; (See SCM 1, section 3.23.) n. Contracts for non-IT services training for state personnel if the cost of the training contract does not exceed $50,000 and the cost of multiple training contracts with a single contractor does not exceed $50,000 cumulatively in any 12-month period. (Historical reference: MM 11-05.) The exemption is for pre-existing training courses; it does not cover development of training or other personal or consulting services. Agencies shall not split contracts to avoid competitive bidding or other contract requirements. Agencies with recurring training needs should assess the cumulative amounts departmentally and generally should go out to bid if there are ongoing and/or department-wide needs."

        "content": "Purpose This policy permits the use of electronic signatures (hereafter “e-Signatures” or e-Sign) in conducting state procurement operations. Policy The Department of General Services Procurement Division permits the use of e-Signatures on all contract documents. E-Signatures: State agencies may accept e-Signatures from all parties as legally binding and equivalent to handwritten signatures to signify an agreement. Each type of e-Signature will include the date the document was signed. Where state or federal laws, regulations, or rules require a handwritten signature, that requirement is met if the document contains an e-signature unless otherwise prohibited by policies, laws or regulations. Scope This policy applies to all transactions governed by the State Contracting Manual (all volumes) and/or conducted by the Department of General Services (DGS) Procurement Division. This policy enables state agency staff to conduct many transactions electronically, to accept e-signatures by other parties, and to sign agreements on the agency’s behalf by using an e-signature. This policy does not waive or modify any requirement or limitation as to which officers and employees are authorized to bind their agency to a contract. History of Approvals and Corrections Required: A chain of approval demonstrates a history of approvals for the electronic document. If corrections are necessary, an email with the requisite “I approve the attached revised document [specify document name, number of other specific document ID]” is needed. Electronic approvals made through FI$Cal meet the approval chain requirements. For Electronic Signature, Electronic Transaction and Electronic Records Management for State Forms please refer to SAM 1734 . For Terms and Definitions related to Electronic Signatures please refer to SAM 1710 ."

Agencies receiving bills from districts constituted prior to 1996 should verify that the districts have gone back and followed the procedures established in current law which would allow the state’s participation. If the validity test is met, then the state agency which owns or controls the property is required to promptly pay its share of the assessment. Management Memo 05-17, Assessments Levied by Local Government Agencies, describes the DGS policy with regards to Local Government Assessments.

In carrying out RELPS’s responsibility for leasing privately owned space, the Leasing Services Unit performs the following functions:\n\nInitiates, negotiates, bids, and executes leases of real property for use by state agencies, including lessor financed, new construction projects, and related amendments, extensions, and terminations related thereto. Initiates, negotiates, bids, and executes leases with purchase options for modular buildings.\n\nThe Leasing Services Unit works in conjunction with the Planning Services Unit on all new space or lease renewal projects as well as new construction projects and modular building leases. Each project has two RELPS team members assigned to work on it; one from the Leasing Services unit and one from the Planning Services unit.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF FINANCE APPROVAL\n\nDOF approval is required if either of the following conditions exist:\n\nRental costs (excluding one-time costs) as determined by RELPS are estimated to exceed $300,000 in any year of the firm term of the lease. (Lease renewals are exempt unless a 10 percent or greater space increase or budget augmentation is required.) The requesting agency will require a budget augmentation for any year within the firm term of the proposed lease. One-time costs associated with the space request, including moving, equipment, furniture, telephones, and data processing related costs must be considered.\n\nDuring the development of a project, if it is determined that the actual costs are going to exceed DOF approved level initially estimated by RELPS, additional review and approval of DOF is required prior to execution of the lease.\n\nSUB-LEASING OF STATE LEASED SPACE\n\nLeased space that becomes excess to the tenant agency’s operations maybe considered for sublease to other governmental or private sector tenants only after it has been determined that the space cannot be used by another state agency and the lease cannot be terminated by the state.\n\nRequests for subleasing space should be submitted to AMB via CRUISE.\n\nInteragency Agreement\n\nAn agency proposing to make a portion of its leased space available to another state agency should prepare an Interagency Agreement form, STD. 213.\n\nRequests for Warehouse or Storage Space\n\nAll requests for new warehouse or storage space exceeding 2,000 square feet will be reviewed by RELPS and the DGS Procurement Division, Material Services Section. They determine how an agency’s needs can be accommodated, or if other alternatives exist, for example, the use of DGS Transit Storage warehousing services.\n\nLeasing Market Information\n\nRELPS leasing staff are familiar with rental rates and market conditions in most locations throughout the state, and often are knowledgeable about specific properties. In addition, RELPS has contracted with private brokerage firms in metropolitan areas to assist in the solicitation and selection of potential buildings for state agencies.\n\nFood Preparation and Vending Machines\n\nThe Department of Rehabilitation ( DOR ) has priority for providing all food service facilities on state property. Tenant agencies must pay all costs for the construction of the facility, the monthly rental for the space, and utilities. Before vending machines may be installed in space that is controlled by the state, the department with control of the space must contact the Business Enterprise Program ( BEP ) located in the DOR. If the BEP elects not to provide the service, vending machines may be installed by another entity. All vending machine income, including commissions from those machines, must be forwarded to BEP pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Sections 19625 and 19630. A copy of the contract with the vending machine operator must be forwarded to DOR as soon as it is fully executed.\n\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act ( CEQA )\n\nCEQA requires consideration of the environmental impact of specific state projects, which includes office leasing. It is generally the responsibility of the requesting agency (lead agency) to comply. The Environmental Services program in PMDB is available on a fee basis to handle CEQA filing requirements.

        "title": "ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT (EVSE) REQUIREMENTS FOR LEASED\n        FACILITIES",
        "content": "A. Overview\n\nAny state agency (hereinafter “client agency”) executing a lease or lease renewal for an office, warehouse, laboratory, or other specialized facility in a privately-owned building, where state fleet vehicle(s) may be domiciled on site, where the firm term of the lease is three (3) years or more, is required to include the installation and maintenance of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and all related infrastructure at the location as a condition of the lease agreement. For the purposes of this section, EVSE refers to one or more fully operational electric vehicle charging stations. State fleet vehicles, defined pursuant to SAM section 3620.1 , include mobile equipment and passenger vehicles; motorcycles are considered mobile equipment.\n\nThe client agency must request and ensure installation of EVSE for all state fleet battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that will be domiciled at that location. The client agency shall also request installation of EVSE for any vehicles that are: (1) eligible for the replacement threshold, defined pursuant to SAM section 4126 , within the firm term of the lease; and, (2) meets the criteria for replacement by a BEV or PHEV pursuant to the ZEV and Hybrid First Purchasing Mandate (see SAM section 4121.1 ).\n\nIt is the responsibility of the client agency to ensure the installation of the number of EVSE is sufficient to support the state fleet vehicles that will be domiciled at that location. Failure to install an adequate quantity of EVSE could jeopardize the client agency’s future state fleet vehicle acquisitions, pursuant to SAM section 4120 . The lack of EVSE at a location is not an allowable exemption to the ZEV and Hybrid First Purchasing Mandate for both light duty vehicles and heavy duty and medium duty vehicles, pursuant to SAM sections 4121.1 and 4121.9 .\n\nThis requirement does not apply to vehicles with special performance requirements necessary for the protection of public safety and welfare, pursuant to SAM section 4121.4 .\n\nB. Fleet Storage and EVSE Plan\n\nWhen submitting a Global Customer Requests: Upgraded Information Sharing Environment (CRUISE) request for a new lease or lease renewal, where state fleet vehicles may be domiciled on site the client agency must submit a Fleet Storage and EVSE Plan (FSEP) to the Department of General Services’ (DGS) Office of Sustainability (OS) Clean Transportation Unit (OS-CTU), which details the state fleet vehicles that the agency intends to domicile at the leased location. The purpose of the FSEP is to determine the quantity of EVSE required at the leased location to support the agency’s fleet for the duration of the firm term of the lease. OS-CTU will consider several factors in its recommendation, including the number of BEVs and PHEVs intended to be domiciled on site, vehicles that may be replaced with by BEVs or PHEVs during the firm term of the lease, and the number of publicly accessible Level 2 and Level 3 chargers in the area. While agencies are encouraged to install infrastructure for workplace charging, the FSEP only considers the infrastructure required to support the agency’s state fleet vehicles.\n\nThe FSEP must be certified by the agency’s Deputy Director (or higher) by electronic signature in the Certification section of the FSEP and submitted electronically to the OS-CTU for approval by email at Sustainability@dgs.ca.gov . The email subject line shall clearly state “Request for FSEP Approval” so that OS-CTU can prioritize review of the form. If any BEV or PHEV vehicle domiciled at this location is deemed a public safety special performance vehicle, the department shall also provide a completed EO B-16-12 Public Safety Special Performance Exemption Request (OFAM 163 form) for those assets. The approved FSEP will specify the quantity of EVSE required at the new facility.\n\nThe OS-CTU approved FSEP must be submitted with the client agency’s Global CRUISE request for a new lease or lease renewal where state fleet vehicles may be domiciled on site. A CRUISE submission for a new lease or lease renewal without an approved FSEP where state fleet vehicles may be domiciled on site will not be reviewed until one is completed.\n\nC. EVSE Installation\n\nThe installation of the required number of EVSE shall be a condition of the lease agreement.\n\nThe DGS’ Real Estate Leasing and Planning Section (RELPS) will negotiate the terms of installation, maintenance, and operation of EVSE with the lessor on behalf of the client agency. Exempting alternative arrangements, the client agency shall be responsible for the cost of installation, service, and maintenance of the EVSE through agency funds or the use of third-party funding opportunities.\n\nRELPS shall consult with OS-CTU to determine what current programs, policies and State contracts may be available to assist the client agency with the procurement and installation of EVSE. The OS-CTU may support leased facilities by providing funding assistance and procurement of EVSE to be installed on lessor-installed infrastructure.\n\nFor new leases, the installation of EVSE must be completed prior to occupancy. For lease renewals, EVSE must be installed within twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the renewal lease.\n\nD. Exemptions\n\nThe client agency may request an exemption to the EVSE requirement through OS-CTU if the client agency can quantitatively demonstrate that the additional cost of installation of EVSE would make the lease or lease renewal cost prohibitive and that sufficient publicly accessible charging infrastructure exists near the site to support the client agency’s fleet. To obtain a waiver under this condition, the client agency must be able to demonstrate that the cost of meeting this requirement would preclude them from relocating or renewing their lease, that alternative domicile sites are available for their state fleet vehicles and that OS-CTU has approved the use of nearby public charging stations identified by the client agency."

Leases of state-owned property are required to reflect fair market rental, with certain exceptions. Leases of state- owned real property for radio and television purposes (telecommunications leases) and other specified uses may exceed the five-year limit.

In accordance with MVC §1023(b), all leases, licenses, and other property uses of Veterans Home Property must be in the best interests of the home and its members. To be in the best interests of the home and its members, all property use must meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\nMember Benefit\n\n1. The property use would principally and directly benefit the members of the home and their medical, welfare, recreation, or similar needs;\n\nOperational Benefit\n\n2. The property use would principally and directly benefit the operations of the home, solely as it relates to the home’s delivery of long-term and residential care to current members;\n\nHealth & Safety Benefit\n\n3. The property use would directly, routinely, substantially, and demonstrably benefit the health and safety of home members; and/or\n\nUse of Existing Facilities\n\n4. The property to be used is an existing home facility that cannot be reasonably operated or repurposed in a manner that meets the preceding criteria, and the terms of the property use agreement would maximize the direct benefit to the home and its members while complying with all other requirements for the use of state property, to include fair market value rent and lease duration.\n\nApproval Determination\n\nB. Only the Secretary or designee shall determine whether the proposed Property use meets these Approval Criteria.\n\nC. These approval criteria shall be applied to all future considerations of new or renewed property use agreements.\n\nD. An activity that principally and directly benefits the home and its members must be provided exclusively or primarily to members, or it must be designed for the particular needs of the home and its members, as opposed to the general public.\n\nGeneral Public\n\n1. Any benefit of property use to the general public, to include non-member veterans, must be ancillary to the intended benefit to the home and its members and must not be a determinative factor in the development of the lease.\n\nRevenue\n\n2. Generation of revenue for any state fund, including the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund, is not an appropriate substitute for this requirement, regardless of how the revenue may be used, unless the event itself is a fundraiser for the benefit of the home and its members.\n\nIncompatible Use\n\nE. Any other third-party uses of home property are incompatible with the letter or intent of MVC §1023(b) and shall not be approved.\n\nIV. EXAMPLES OF APPROPRIATE PROPERTY USE\n\nA. Examples of third-party activities that principally and directly benefit the home and its members include:\n\nBeneficial Third Party Activities\n\n1. Meetings of veterans or support groups, provided that attendance significantly consists of home members;\n\n2. Onsite barbershops and salons that primarily serve home members;\n\n3. Fundraisers and meetings by support foundations for the purposes of soliciting and distributing donations for the home and its members;\n\n4. State-owned housing leases for home employees;\n\n5. Events such as picnics, holiday parties, and Veterans Day celebrations, which may be operated or sponsored by third parties but primarily serve home members and their families; and\n\n6. Medical care, financial assistance, or similar services to be provided for home members.\n\nB. Examples of third-party activities that do not principally and directly benefit the home and its members include:\n\nThird-Party Activities Without Direct Benefit\n\n1. Private events, such as corporate events and company picnics, in which home members are not the primary participants or beneficiaries;\n\n2. Leases and events that primarily benefit the community at large, even if they provide a secondary benefit to home members, such as free admission;\n\n3. Walking, running, or cycling events not primarily composed of home members, unless the event is held for the explicit purpose of raising donations and providing support for the home and its members;\n\n4. Activities that benefit veterans in the community and do not provide a significant benefit to home members; and\n\n5. Activities that create undue disruption or risk for the home or its members or are otherwise incompatible with the mission of the home, regardless of the type, purpose, or beneficiary of the activity.\n\nThird-Party Activities Benefiting Health & Safety\n\nC. Examples of third-party leases that are in the best interests of the home, regardless of the principal beneficiary, due to the direct, routine, substantial, and demonstrable benefit to the health and safety of home members include:\n\n1. An active firefighting or law enforcement facility that regularly dispatches firefighters or police officers to respond to emergencies on the campus of the home; and\n\n2. A clinic or other medical facility that regularly provides healthcare services to members of the home."

Many voice systems include an additional step such as keypad verification to confirm agreement. To use a recorded voice as an e-Signature, it must: Be associated with the speaker; Be associated with a specific document or record; Show evidence of the speaker’s intent to be bound to the terms and conditions in that specific document or record; Be captured in electronic format.\n\nPersonal Identification Number (PIN) or Password : When using a PIN or password for an e-Signature, a person accessing an application is requested to enter identifying information, which may include an identification number, the person’s name and a \"shared secret\" (called \"shared\" because it is known to both the user and the system), such as a PIN and/or password. The system checks that the PIN and/or password is indeed associated with the person accessing the system and \"authenticates\" the person. Sometimes the entry of some personal information (for example: name or date of birth) along with the PIN and password is also required.\n\nDigitized Image of Handwritten Signature : A digitized signature is a graphical image of a handwritten signature. Some applications require a person to create a handwritten signature using a special computer input device, such as a digital pen and pad. Digitized signatures are most often used in face-to-face consumer transactions using credit cards. Some applications can compare the digitized representation of the entered signature with a stored copy of the graphical image of the signature. A digitized signature may be another form of shared secret known both to the person and to the system. Forging a digitized signature can be more difficult than forging a paper signature because the technology that compares the submitted signature image with the known signature image is more accurate than the human eye.\n\nDigital Signatures : The California Secretary of State has established regulations for Acceptable Technologies for Digital Signatures. See California Code of Regulations, Title 2, § 22003. There are two main types of digital signatures, one using Symmetric Cryptography and the other using Asymmetric Cryptography. Symmetric Cryptography or Shared Private Key: In this e-Signature method, a person electronically signs using a single cryptographic key that is not publicly known, for authentication purposes. The same key is used to sign a document and verify the signer’s identity and is shared between the signer and the entity hosting the transaction requiring the signature. Asymmetric Cryptography or Public/Private Key: To produce a digital signature, two mathematically linked keys are generated - a private signing key that is kept private, and a public validation key that is publicly available. The two keys are mathematically linked, but the private key cannot be deduced from the public key. The public key is often made part of a \"digital certificate,\" which is a digitally signed electronic document binding the individual’s identity to a private key in an unalterable fashion. Digital signatures are often used within the context of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in which a trusted third party known as a Certification Authority binds individuals to private keys and issues and manages certificates.\n\nTerms and Definitions Related to Electronic Signatures\n\nAuthentication: The process of securely verifying the identity of an individual prior to allowing access to an electronic service. Automated Transaction: A transaction conducted or performed, in whole or in part, by electronic means or electronic records, in which the acts or records of one or both parties are not reviewed by an individual in the ordinary course in forming a contract, performing under an existing contract, or fulfilling an obligation required by the transaction. Electronic: Relating to technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities. Electronic Agent: A computer program or an electronic or other automated means used independently to initiate an action or respond to electronic records or performances in whole or in part, without review by an individual. Electronic Record: A record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means. Electronic Signature: An electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the electronic record. For purposes of this title, a “digital signature” as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 16.5 of the Government Code is a type of electronic signature. Information: Data, text, images, sounds, codes, computer programs, software, databases, or the like. Record: Information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form. Security Procedure: A procedure employed for the purpose of verifying that an electronic signature, record, or performance is that of a specific person or for detecting changes or errors in the information in an electronic record. The term includes a procedure that requires the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, or callback or other acknowledgment procedures. Transaction: An action or set of actions occurring between two or more persons relating to the conduct of business, commercial, or governmental affairs. Wet or Original Signature: A signature that is created when a person physically writes a name in a stylized, cursive format (or even a simple “X”) on a piece of paper.\n\nGeneral Terms and Definitions\n\nForms – Any documents containing locked content or requests that are used repeatedly.

All agency departmental forms and all state standard (STD) forms must contain the term “State of California”, the authoring department’s name, a form title, a form number, and a form creation or revision date. Contact the Forms Management Center (FMC) for information about forms design standards and software.\n\nAll State forms must comply with all other applicable form requirements (see SAM Section 1745).\n\nForms not included in the STD Forms Program may not carry “STD” or any variation of that designation as a prefix to the form number. If a form is removed from coordination as an STD form and returned to management of the generating agency, the agency must change the number and identification. These forms may carry a statement such as “Formerly STD XXX”’.\n\nAll agency forms must show certain identifying information. If there is space, you should place this information together on the form. The Forms Handbook shows formatting for this information.\n\nForm Titles – Form titles must describe both the form’s subject and function. See the Forms Handbook for help with titling forms.\n\nForm Numbers – Ideally, form numbers should be prefixed by the initials of the agency, i.e., FTB, SCO, etc. The numbers may follow any plan or scheme that works for your agency but must not duplicate a number already in use by the agency. A form used by an office or division within an agency may carry a sub-prefix. An example is “DGS OLS” for the DGS, Office of Legal Services.\n\nCreation or Revision Dates – The date, must be the month and year in which the form was created or first distributed, such as “MM/YYYY”. If it is revised, the date will be the month and year in which the form was revised, such as “‘Rev. 01/2020”’.\n\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) Format - Converting or developing forms in an HTML format can provide many benefits, including but not limited to: ADA compliance, increased business process efficiencies, secured data collection as well as enabling automated workflows to be adopted more easily.\n\nAgencies must use the current standard, HTML5 or higher.\n\nAgencies must consider usability of the forms and build them to have a responsive and extensible design. (Ex. Mobile devices, tablets, laptops etc.).\n\nIt is not advisable to preprint names of employees on forms unless there are compelling reasons to do so. An exception may be made for names of elected or appointed officials."

        "title": "ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND ELECTRONIC RECORD\n        MANAGEMENT FOR STATE FORMS",
        "content": "Purpose\n\nThis policy requires all forms that are designed to be completed by internal or external customers (public or private sector entities) conducting business with the State of California, whether standard (STD) or agency forms, are available in an electronic format. Agencies shall use electronic signatures (hereafter “e-Signatures” or “e-Sign”) in place of a wet signature unless prohibited by law.\n\nThis policy identifies the permissible types of e-Signatures, electronic transactions, and electronic records (hereafter “e-Records”) when utilizing forms for state business.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy applies to all business processes conducted using forms managed by Forms Management Center (FMC) including STD forms and agency business-use forms. This policy enables state agency staff to conduct transactions electronically, to accept e-Signatures by other parties, and to sign agreements on the agency’s behalf by using an e-Signature. This policy does not waive or modify any requirement or limitation as to which officers and employees are authorized to bind their agency to a contract.\n\nThis policy does not affect a state agency’s right or obligation to have forms be provided or made available in alternate formats when required by applicable policies, laws, or regulations.\n\nBackground\n\nFederal legislation known as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act made both electronic contracts and e-Signatures as legal and enforceable, with some exceptions, as traditional paper contracts and forms signed in person.\n\nFollowing the federal government’s lead, California adopted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (California Civil Code § 1633.1-1633.17), which establishes the legal validity of e-Signatures and contracts in a manner similar to the federal law.\n\nCalifornia law was revised to make clear that the state is authorized to use any type of e-Signature. See AB 2296 (Chapter 144, Statutes of 2016), effective 1/1/17.\n\nPolicy\n\nState agencies shall ensure all forms are digitally available and can accept e-Signatures. When an electronic form is transmitted to a state agency, the chain of approval of all those required to sign that document must be clear and unambiguous. All parties required to sign must have unequivocally approved the same document.\n\nAgency Responsibilities\n\nWhen implementing the use of e-Signatures, agencies shall:\n\nImplement an e-Signature policy; Implement confidentiality procedures to address accurate identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability; Implement integrity procedures to address non-repudiation; Maintain an e-Record management procedure to ensure electronic form storage and availability; Ensure processes and technologies are in place to accept and enable the use of e-Signatures; Format forms requiring signatures to accept e-Signatures.\n\nThe Department of General Services (DGS) and FMC permit the use of the following e-Signatures, transactions and record management activities in conducting state business with STD or Agency forms:\n\nElectronic Signatures: State agencies may accept permissible types of e-Signatures from all parties as legally binding and equivalent to handwritten signatures to signify an agreement. Each type of e-Signature will include the date the document was signed. Where state or federal laws, regulations, or rules require a handwritten signature, that requirement is met if the document contains an e-Signature unless otherwise prohibited by policies, laws, or regulations. Electronic forms must clearly and unambiguously show the chain of approval of all parties required to sign that document. Electronic Transactions: State business operations utilizing forms can now be completed electronically. In some cases, state agencies may have a legal obligation to collect a wet signature. In such cases, some forms will still need to be submitted to the agency in paper format. These requirements may change over time as technology adoption is implemented into policy. Record Management: An e-Record may serve as the official copy of a business-related document. All relevant records, including e-Records, shall be maintained in a reliable recordkeeping system. Business conducted by electronic means shall be fully documented to meet recordkeeping requirements. Records shall be retained or disposed of in accordance with the approved records retention schedules stated in California State Records and Information Management (CalRIM) as supported by the State Contracting Manual (SCM) and the State Administrative Manual (SAM) 1600 et seq .\n\nTypes of E-Signatures Permitted for Use on State and Agency Forms by State Agencies\n\nOnly the following types of e-Signatures (further defined in SAM 1710) can be used on forms by state agencies.\n\nName Typed or Stamped Recorded Voice Personal Identification Number (PIN) or Password Digitized Image of Handwritten Signature Digital Signature\n\nA form needs to include a statement confirming agreement (for example: “I confirm”, “I agree”, or “I accept”) that is tied to the e-Signature to create a binding electronic record. Most state and agency forms already include this language above the signature block."

State agencies are expected to make a reasonable determination as to what functions must continue outside of these hours.\n\nBuilding Heating and Cooling Systems\n\nFacility managers shall allow building temperatures to fluctuate within an acceptable range to avoid wasteful over-control patterns. This range may vary with each building’s control system; the target range is plus or minus two degrees Fahrenheit from the temperature set point, for a total fluctuation of four degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature set point should be no higher than 68°F in winter and no lower than 78°F in summer; unless such a temperature in a particular job or occupation may expose employees to a health and safety risk. Simultaneous or alternate heating and cooling operations to maintain exact temperature in work areas shall be avoided. Whenever practical, facility managers shall operate and adjust controls to get optimum advantage from outside temperatures for meeting cooling demand (e.g., using outside air economizers and night flush cycles). Avoid operating chillers and compressors when possible. All “pre-cooling” options for buildings shall be employed. State employees are prohibited from using personal heaters without the express written consent of the facility manager or an approved reasonable accommodation request. state employee shall keep windows and doors closed to prevent loss of heated or cooled air, unless the facility manager has indicated that the building is specifically designed for natural ventilation efficiency. State employees in state-occupied locations shall adjust window blinds or coverings, if installed, to prevent solar heat gain during summer and prevent heat loss in winter. Facility managers shall order data center operators to maintain ambient temperature settings at manufacturer specification maximums. Facility managers shall not set domestic hot water temperatures above 105° F unless this conflicts with a code requirement for the facility. Facility managers and state employees in state-occupied locations shall take every opportunity to minimize hot water usage.\n\nYear-Round Maintenance\n\nFacility managers shall inspect and maintain ducts, air filters, and related hardware to maximize effectiveness at the lowest acceptable power use. Facility managers shall tune up all forced and induced draft gas and oil-fired boilers at least twice annually. If there are automated combustion controls, verification of combustion efficiency shall be conducted at least twice annually.\n\nLighting\n\nState employees in state-occupied locations shall turn off all lights in unoccupied rooms. Facility managers shall install occupancy sensors whenever practical. Occupancy sensors shall be selected to be appropriate to the room geometry and usage patterns of the space.When areas served exceed 10,000 square feet, occupancy sensors should undergo quality assurance testing included in building systems that are commissioned. Facility managers shall reduce lamps and/or luminaires in number and/or wattage to provide the lighting level appropriate for the activities of the work area affected. Facility managers shall replace any incandescent lighting with higher efficiency sources, such as fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), light-emitting diode (LED), or induction lighting whenever replacement is required. For fluorescent lights, facility managers shall have a plan by December 2015 to replace any older “core and coil” magnetic ballasts with newer energy-efficient electronic ballasts. Facility managers shall install some form of daylight controls in day-lit zones (near windows and under skylights). When such day-lit areas exceed 10,000 square feet, or are part of new construction or a major renovation, these day lighting controls (e.g., sensors that adjust artificial lighting in response to the available natural light) should be included in building systems that are commissioned. Where practical, facility managers shall consider the significant energy savings made possible by the selection of lower level general ambient lighting with small- area, high-efficiency fluorescent or LED task lighting for higher level task lighting requirements – an approach particularly appropriate for work stations and computer use areas. When painting or renovating, use light colored ceiling, wall, floor and desk surfaces throughout building to boost overall ambient illumination levels (dark surfaces absorb light). Keep lighting fixtures clean to maintain lighting levels. Facility managers shall have custodial personnel turn lights on only as needed and turn lights off when their work is done. Where practical, have custodial personnel work in teams to complete cleaning on each floor of multi-story buildings.\n\nPlug Loads\n\nState employees shall not plug in any personal devices, including but not limited to coffee pots, microwaves, refrigerators, and heaters, in workspaces. Exception: the following may be allowed if the facility manager determines that the circuit can safely accommodate the electrical load: Facility managers shall work with employees and vendors to ensure that all equipment in employee kitchens, lunch rooms, and other shared spaces complies with the following: Additions of new equipment must have a current ENERGY STAR rating, when available; As practical, strive to replace refrigerators and equipment manufactured prior to 2000 with more efficient models; Refrigerated beverage vending machines and hot/cold water dispensers that are purchased, leased, or supplied by an outside vendor must be ENERGY STAR rated to the current version, when available; All vending machines with non-perishable items must comply with one of the following: Have built-in low power modes for lighting and refrigeration, as applicable and described in ENERGY STAR program requirements for refrigerated beverage machines, version 3.0, section 3)B); or The facility manager has installed an after-market occupancy sensor. Coffee makers must shut off automatically; Equipment must be regularly cleaned and maintained to optimize efficiency.\n\n3. Facility managers shall install power strips with timer settings and/or inexpensive, energy-efficient timers to turn off equipment during non-work hours (including paper shredders, lighted ambient snack vending machines, and hot/cold water dispensers). In implementation of this section, facility managers shall follow any applicable procurement guidelines established for such equipment.\n\n4. Department directors or their designees shall distribute an annual email to educate all employees about the importance of minimizing electrical plug loads and to review relevant state policies and guidelines.\n\nDemand Response\n\nFacility managers should be proactive in contacting their local utility to research the va rious demand response programs and select appropriate options, when applicable. When an electrical emergency is predicted for the day, the facility manager shall alert state employees and building operations in anticipation of the emergency, and shall implement curtailment measures immediately upon or before the emergency declaration.\n\nIn facilities with appropriate energy management systems installed, automated demand response should be considered."

        "content": "Purpose\n\nThis policy was outlined in Management Memo 17-04 and provides state agencies and building professionals with the requirements for meeting zero net energy (ZNE), as well as the direction, strategies and procedures that will help them achieve ZNE for new building design and construction, and build-to-suit leases, as well as existing state-owned buildings.\n\nThis policy is part of a series of directives to state agencies designed to implement the Governor’s Executive Order (EO) B-18-12 on energy and resource conservation in state buildings.\n\nPolicy\n\nExecutive Order B-18-12 requires the following actions to reduce the environmental impact of state facilities on climate change:\n\nAll new State buildings and major renovations beginning design after 2025 shall be constructed as Zero Net Energy facilities. 50% of new facilities beginning design after 2020 shall be Zero Net Energy. State agencies shall also take measures toward achieving Zero Net Energy for 50% of the square footage of existing State-owned building area by 2025. To facilitate achieving these goals the following shall apply: All new state buildings, major renovations, and build-to-suit leases beginning design after October 23, 2017, shall be designed and built following cost-effective energy efficiency strategies for achieving ZNE identified below. Departments shall work to improve energy efficiency in existing buildings in the most cost cost-effective manner to meet or exceed energy efficiency targets established in energy efficiency strategies for achieving ZNE identified below. Renewable energy generation shall be added to state facilities either onsite, and/or offsite to achieve EO B-18-12 targets by following renewable energy generation prioritization and strategies identified below.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\nEnergy use reporting is already required monthly into the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager database (see SAM chapter 1815.4 ). Departments shall also provide status on compliance with this policy in their department Sustainability Road Map .\n\nDefinition of Zero Net Energy (ZNE)\n\nZNE Source – Energy Efficient building that produces as much clean renewable energy as it consumes over the course of a year, when accounted for at the energy generation source.\n\nSource energy represents the total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate the building. It incorporates all fuel extraction, transmission, delivery, and production losses. By taking all energy use into account, the ZNE definition provides a complete assessment of energy used in buildings.\n\nDefinitions of other terms can be found in the Green California Glossary .\n\nEnergy Measurement and Calculation\n\nMeasurement of source energy converts all energy sources into common units of Source kBtu using established conversion factors for each energy source. Energy use quantities are included in the Energy Star Portfolio Manager reporting 1 . Source energy conversion factors shall be applied to energy metrics from all energy sources, including district energy and renewable energy and shall be based on national averages in ASHRAE Standard 105-2014 2 . They are also included in a ZNE Calculato r for State Buildings. Energy used for Zero Emission Vehicle charging or fueling is excluded from building total energy for ZNE calculations.\n\nState agencies shall utilize the following strategies to achieve ZNE at state facilities whenever possible and cost-effective to ensure the highest output and efficiency possible, reduce long-term operating budgets and reduce or avoid any uneconomical over- generation of renewable energy:\n\nEnergy Efficiency – Ultra-low energy use through energy conservation, passive systems and whole-building integrated energy efficiency measures should always be the initial focus for each building pursuing ZNE. New Construction, Major Renovations and Build-to-Suit Leases – All new projects shall exceed the applicable version of California code (California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 6), by fifteen percent or more. (This is already required by EO B-18-12 and identified in its Green Building Action Plan ) Build-to-suit leases apply where the state will likely become the eventual owner of the building, and the state is the sole tenant. All new projects should design and construction facilities to maximize efficiency, and accommodate on-site renewable energy to the extent feasible and cost-effective, whether onsite renewables are installed with new project, or at a later date. This may include site orientation, massing, layout, landscape design, roof design and orientation, and mechanical/electrical room layouts. If onsite renewable energy is not possible, or feasible, other renewable energy generation strategies may be utilized (see Renewable Energy Generation categories below.) Design and install conduits and chases for eventual wiring and plumbing required for connecting site and/or building renewable energy systems to mechanical/electrical rooms. Departments with decision-making authority are responsible to implement energy efficiency measures into all new construction and major renovation projects, and meet energy efficiency targets, or exceed them to the extent cost effective. The Department of General Services (DGS) is responsible for implementing these measures into buildings for Departments without this authority. All departments are responsible to conserve energy to the extent feasible, through procurement of energy-efficient office equipment, and other measures identified in SAM Section 1805.3 – Standard Operating Efficiency Procedures . A ZNE Decision Making Matrix for State Agencies helps identify measures and responsibilities of owners, tenants of new and existing state buildings pursuing ZNE. Existing Buildings – Existing state buildings should strive to achieve high levels of energy efficiency before adding renewable energy to achieve ZNE. While state agencies are required to take measures toward achieving ZNE on 50 percent or more of their building area, they should work to achieve high energy efficiency levels in their entire portfolios to the extent cost effective. Energy efficiency for ZNE is to be measured using Source Energy Use Intensity (Source EUI), and uses the following units of measurement – kBtu/sq. ft. Source (thousand British thermal units per square foot of building area). This metric can currently be extracted from the Energy Star Portfolio Manager in a report, but can also be calculated using the ZNE Calculator . Energy efficiency targets for existing state buildings are derived from 2015 historic state-owned building energy data and some national data. These energy efficiency targets are established as the top quartile of energy use for each building type. For some building types (i.e. offices & other types) EUI targets are established for some specific state occupancies, as well. This accounts for variations from differences in occupancy, hours of use, equipment, etc. Source EUI targets for Existing State Buildings are all listed in the linked table and includes variations for each of the 16 California Climate Zones. These are soft EUI targets that state agencies should attempt to achieve for buildings or facilities pursuing ZNE. They are intended as a guide, as some circumstances may vary affecting the feasible achievability of some targets. Energy use reduction in existing buildings can be achieved through a variety of measures including: Upgrading lighting systems and controls to more efficient systems Upgrading heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and/or controls for improved efficiency Improving thermal performance of building envelope (insulation, glazing, roofing, etc.) Reducing plug loads by improving efficiency of equipment and appliances used in building ( see SAM chapter 1805 ) Energy conservation measures of occupants Retro-commissioning and monitoring-based commissioning, as required and outlined by SAM Section 1815.3 The DGS Energy Efficiency Retrofit Program provides support for state departments on energy efficiency upgrades utilizing ESCo’s, and other alternative financing options. A ZNE Decision Making Matrix for State Agencies helps identify measures and responsibilities of owners, tenants of new and existing state buildings pursuing ZNE.\n\nRenewable Energy Generation\n\nIn addition to achievement of energy efficiency targets, renewable energy must be generated and used to offset the annual energy use of the facilities achieving ZNE. Renewable energy generation should come from the following sources, as much as possible in the priority listed (a through d below), but can include a combination of the following approaches. In all cases Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) must be retired (not sold to other customers) for all renewable energy systems.\n\nBuilding – Generate and use renewable energy on-site to the extent possible and cost-effective. This can utilize rooftops, or the building site (parking lot, adjacent land) for on-site renewable generation. On-site systems can be purchased as part of projects, procured through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA’s), or through other means. DGS provides assistance procuring PPA’s through its Clean Energy Generation Program . It is strongly advised that all on-site renewable energy system procurement include services for operation and maintenance to assure that system operation and generation persists for the life of the equipment. Campus – Generate and use renewable energy within a multiple building campus to the extent possible. This can utilize rooftops, or the building or campus site (parking lot, adjacent land, common areas) for on-site renewable generation. Advantages of campus generation include that excess renewable energy generation, above the amount of the building(s) achieving ZNE can be used to offset other campus loads. Portfolio – Generate and use renewable energy within an owner’s portfolio to the extent possible. Multiple building sites by the same owner could be used and aggregated so that the combined on-site renewable energy could offset the combined building energy from the aggregated building sites. This could apply to the entire portfolio, or portions of the portfolio. This approach would allow ZNE to be achieved for energy-efficient buildings within the portfolio where the capacity for on-site renewable energy is very restricted. While preferable, it is not required that renewable generation using the portfolio approach be in the same utility grid as the building achieving ZNE. This approach may require a cooperative agreement with the utility, and could also provide an outlet for excess renewable energy production during periods of the day when over-generation of electricity is likely, to avoid financial losses from selling back excess energy wholesale to utilities. Community – Generate renewable energy within the state for use at the facility, after other feasible options have been exhausted to the extent possible. This could be applied to allow long-term purchase agreements of state-generated, renewable energy, dedicated to providing energy for the building(s). Agreements should extend a minimum of 20 years, and must specify that the RECs are owned by the electricity customer and retired by the utility. Some utilities may offer customers the opportunity to enter a long-term contract to purchase renewable energy from the utility for some portion of the energy used at the site. The contract must be for at least 20 years and must specify that RECs are owned by the electricity customer and will be retired by the utility. Short-term RECs would not be allowed to be counted toward achievement of ZNE, while they are still effective to reduce GHG emissions. Other renewable generation strategies to consider Share excess generation – Whenever possible, excess generation should be utilized on-site through energy storage, with other buildings on campus, or through utility agreements with other buildings in portfolio. Install energy storage – Utilize on-site energy storage (batteries, thermal, etc.) to shift energy use for peak load reduction, limit over- generation sent back to the grid, reduce demand charges, reduce energy costs by taking advantage of time-of-use (TOU) rates, and provide cloud cover and outage protection for the facility. PV array orientation – To the extent possible, orient the PV arrays in way that maximizes alignment of the onsite generation with the onsite electrical load. This approach should be reviewed and adjusted over time to provide alignment with the needs of the utility grid. Use over-generated energy for EVSE charging – Electric vehicle service equipment (EVSE) can utilize excess energy generated to charge electric vehicles. This will help reduce or avoid export of over- generated electricity, and help agencies meet zero-emission vehicle charging infrastructure goals. Energy used for electric vehicle charging does not count toward building energy use, nor does it need to be included in ZNE building calculations. However, electricity generated through on-site renewables that is used for EV charging can be used in ZNE calculations to offset non-EV-charging electricity and natural gas use at the site. Renewable heating and cooling (including ground source heat pumps or district heating), electrification, and other technologies to improve efficiency. Mixed source of renewable energy – Consider mixed sources of renewable energy from multiple sources, to mirror best grid optimization. For example, wind power also generates without sunlight, and during non-daylight hours. Renewable heating and cooling (including ground source heat pumps or district heating), electrification, and other technologies to improve efficiency.\n\nAdditional Energy Reference Policies\n\nState departments should have implemented the practices incorporated into the State Administrative Manual (SAM) Chapter 1800, Sustainable Operations and Practices , in the operation and maintenance of their facilities.

For agencies whose cooling is supplied through the downtown Sacramento Central Plant, the Department of Technology can provide specific instructions for the calculations. Agencies are responsible for submitting these reports, and must base their PUE calculations on the criteria outlined in the Green Grid publication . Data centers that exceed a PUE of 1.5 shall reduce their PUE by a minimum of 10 percent per year until they achieve a 1.5 or lower PUE. These reductions can be achieved through energy saving measures and/or through scheduled and budgeted power and cooling supply equipment replacements. If agencies that manage data centers 1,000 square feet or larger do not have the expertise to reduce PUE, the Department of Technology can provide suggestions. The Department of General Services and local utilities also are excellent resources to suggest energy savings measures. When purchasing network switches and routers, all state agencies must specify the Energy Efficient Ethernet IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.3-2012 Section 6 standard to the maximum extent possible. (Download a free copy of this IEEE standard from (the IEEE Standards Association ). All state agencies must consider virtualization (options when refreshing equipment or standing up new systems. Virtualization is the creation of a virtual rather than actual version of something such as an operating system a server a storage device or network resources. Use of the most energy efficient power supplies available should be included in the purchase of new IT equipment."

They include:\n\nExisting Landscapes : Should be maintained to survive the drought with reclaimed water whenever possible. Protect high priority landscape elements such as existing trees, ground covers and shrubs. Protect all slopes from erosion. Convert conventional spray heads or rotors to drip and/or low precipitation rate nozzles. A minimum three inch (3″) layer of mulch shall be applied on all exposed soil surfaces of planting areas except in turf areas, creeping or rooting groundcovers, or direct seeding applications. Existing Lawns : During a declared drought, low priority landscapes such as lawns without trees shall be watered only to the extent to a minimum to control dust and erosion. The University of California, Davis publication, Managing Turfgrasses during Drought , provides useful information on warm-season and cool-season grasses in California. Trees in lawn areas that provide shade to buildings and hardscapes are high priority. Add drip irrigation around the drip line of the tree or water slowly and deeply with a trickling hose to increase survival rate. Trees can develop Phytophthora root rot if soil around their base remains wet for long periods. To prevent excessive growth, do not fertilize lawns. Follow the US Composting Council guidelines when using compost to retain moisture on existing lawns. * Refer to latest version of the California Department of Water Resource’s model water efficiency landscape ordinance, section 490.1(e) for exceptions . Low Water Use Landscape : All new and rehabilitation landscape projects shall comply with the latest version of the California Department of Water Resource’s model water efficiency landscape ordinance ( MWELO, 2015 Revision ). Irrigation : Installation of irrigation sub-meters, flow meters, master valves and smart irrigation controllers are recommended. Overhead irrigation shall be scheduled between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. unless weather conditions prevent it. If allowable hours of irrigation differ from the local water purveyor, the stricter of the two shall apply. Operation of the irrigation system outside the normal watering window is allowed for auditing and system maintenance. Observe irrigation cycles and if water is running off, adjust irrigation timers to run for less time, but more frequently (as allowed). Establish a water budget for the landscape based on the plants, landscape area and local climate, and schedule irrigation based on the weather, soil type and to meet the water budget. (Click here for cycle and soak methods.) Sustainable Grounds and Landscape Maintenance Practices : Sustainable landscaping practices produce significant economic and environmental benefits. Savings include reduced labor, water and fertilizer cost, lower hauling expenses and disposal fees. Standard landscaping practices include grass- cycling, lawn aeration, mulching, and composting practices that enhance the soil. These practices increase the water-holding capacity of soil, reduce erosion, and conserve water. Where appropriate, choose plants that are native or of low water use and are non-invasive to the area; consider mature plant size as it relates to available planting space to reduce pruning needs. Erosion, Sedimentation Control and Storm Water Retention : Follow recommendations for prevention of erosion, storm water pollution and reducing peak runoff found in 5.106.1 Storm Water Pollution Prevention (p.31), 5.106.10 Grading and Paving (p.34) in the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code (or current edition). Where possible, incorporate A5.106.2 Storm Water Design (page 100) and A5.106.3 Low Impact Development (LID)(page100)."

        "content": "To reduce the harmful effects of chemicals and air pollution on the local environment and to promote water and energy conservation during exterior maintenance activities, departments are required to develop a maintenance program consistent with the guidelines outlined in Sustainable Site Credit 2: Building Exterior and Hardscape Management Plan of LEED 2009 or the Sustainable Sites Prerequisite of LEED v4 for Existing Buildings Operations and Maintenance and in accordance with the additions and modifications described in this policy. Departments are required to amend service contract documents as necessary to support the policy requirements. Chemicals: The use of harsh chemicals is not usually necessary for most building exterior maintenance activities. The strength of the cleaning solutions should approximate the level sufficient to obtain satisfactory results. Do not use cleaning solutions stronger than necessary for the particular task. Cleaning solutions for exterior maintenance should be Green Seal certified or equivalent and should conform to Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) guidelines as stated in SAM 1850 . Exterior Maintenance : Sweeping or raking are the preferred methods of exterior cleaning; blowing is allowed when appropriate and when authorized by facilities management . When using a blower, electric or battery powered equipment should be used. Engine powered blowers may be utilized in compelling circumstances and with the prior authorization of facilities management . Departments are to adopt building exterior maintenance programs that conserve water. These programs include using manual cleaning methods over those that require high volume water spraying equipment. Water use, while sometimes necessary to carry out certain cleaning activities, should be carefully monitored to avoid excessive waste and runoff. If pressurized washing equipment is necessary, use equipment at the lowest output settings necessary to achieve satisfactory results. When power washing equipment is needed, use electric powered or battery- powered equipment to reduce air and noise pollution. Gasoline powered equipment should only be used in unusual circumstances and only with the prior authorization of facilities management. Departments are to replace gasoline-powered equipment with zero-emission strategies including (but not limited to) electric, battery powered or manual equipment as equipment replacement schedules allow. Hardscape: Water should never be used for general sweeping of hardscape although pressurized water use for purposes of specific removal of stains or grime from pavement, or for hygienic reasons, is considered reasonable use. State facility childcare centers with playgrounds and patios where food can be consumed should also be hygienically and routinely maintained. The monitored use of pressurized water would be appropriate for these areas as well. Landscape: Landscaping tasks should be done with manual equipment whenever possible. For tasks that require power equipment, electric or battery powered equipment should be used whenever possible. Equipment in this category includes, but is not limited to, mowers, leaf blowers, string trimmers, hedge trimmers, chainsaws, pole saws, and tillers. Electric equipment shall be charged with grid electricity and never with a portable generator. Engine powered lawn and garden equipment may only be used in compelling circumstances with the prior authorization of facilities management.Departments are to replace gasoline-powered equipment with zero-emission strategies including (but not limited to) electric, battery powered or manual equipment as equipment replacement schedules allow. Roofing Cleaning : Roofs should be maintained on a periodic basis consistent with the roof type (built-up, single-ply, metal, cool roof, etc.); manufacturers’ warranty requirements; location environment (coastal, urban, desert, mountain, etc.); and other external factors that affect roof performance, reflectivity and longevity. Department maintenance programs should establish roof cleaning methods and frequencies specific to the needs of each building roof to avoid unnecessary cleaning and overuse of water and cleaning solvents. Simple hand removal of debris from roofs, drains, gutters, downspouts, and overflows is often sufficient. Unwarranted frequent cleaning with powered equipment can reduce the lifespan of the roof by wearing down protective coatings and roofing materials. When powered roof cleaning equipment is necessary, equipment with a water recovery/recycle system should be considered in the maintenance program for the appropriate roof type. Refer to local municipalities for additional requirements. Exterior Painting: Building maintenance often requires the repainting of exterior walls. Paints shall either be no or low volatile organic compound (VOC) and contain recycled content when obtainable, meeting industry performance standards (see Green Seal GS-43 Standard ), unless prior authorization is obtained from facilities management to use something else. Use water-based paints over those containing oils. When spray equipment is used, ensure that care is exercised to prevent overspray and runoff, particularly near people, vegetation, waterways, and storm drains. Training : Departments are responsible for providing training and instruction to maintenance personnel and contractors on the proper use, handling, recycling and/or disposal of all solvents and paint products. (Refer to SAM Section 1930.9 .)Personnel should be directed to use manual methods of cleaning and painting whenever possible and to avoid the risk of excessive discharge with powered equipment."

See: Carpet for Business\n\nStep 2: Provide Appropriate Ventilation, Filtration, and HVAC Equipment Maintenance.\n\nExisting Buildings – Maintenance and Operation Operate HVAC systems continuously during work hours and provide no less than the required minimum outdoor air requirements in effect when the building permit was issued, or if no building permit was issued, when the building was designed, constructed or renovated. Please refer to Cal- OSHA’s Title 8 regulations, Section §5142: Mechanically Driven Heating, Ventilating and Air- Conditioning (HVAC) Systems to Provide Minimum Building Ventilation, at Control of Hazardous Substances Inspect HVAC systems at least annually; all HVAC inspections and maintenance shall be documented in writing (as required by Title 8, Section 5142). Annual inspections shall also include: Verification of minimum outdoor airflows using properly calibrated hand- held airflow measuring instruments. Confirmation that air filters are clean and replaced according to the manufacturer’s specified interval or more frequently as needed based on specific local or seasonal conditions. Use high Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) filters as specified below. Verify that outdoor dampers, actuators, and associated linkages operate properly. Check the condition of all accessible heat exchanger surfaces for fouling and microbial growth, and take action as needed. Check condensate drain pans for proper drainage and possible microbial growth, and take action as needed to correct and to prevent future drain blockages and microbial growth. To the extent accessible, inspect the first 20 feet of all lined ductwork downstream of cooling coils for visible microbial growth. If microbial growth is found, correct and take action to prevent future growth. Ensure that cooling towers are properly maintained and records of chemical treatment of cooling tower water are kept. Cooling tower plume discharges closer than 25 feet to any building intake shall be retrofitted where possible to meet the 25-foot requirement. Building managers shall develop a comprehensive HVAC preventative maintenance program Where feasible, use filters with a MERV rating of no less than 11, as specified in Section A5.504.5.3.1 of CALGreen. Existing HVAC systems incapable of accommodating increased pressure drops associated with the 11 MERV rating shall use the highest MERV rating that their fan(s) can accommodate while providing the design airflows. To the extent possible, all fan change-outs shall be sized to accommodate MERV 13 filters. Provide ongoing factory training for stationary engineers on proper operation and maintenance of all new and existing equipment, as well as all building management systems. Initiate a computer-based preventive maintenance program for all HVAC equipment Provide specialized air treatment for buildings in areas where air quality standards are routinely exceeded. Consider using: Particulate matter air filters with a minimum MERV rating of 13 or higher (if feasible) for buildings in areas where the Environmental Protection Agency ( US EPA ) standards for PM10 (particulate matter) or PM2.5 are routinely exceeded. Ozone-removing air cleaning deviceswith a minimum volumetric ozone removal efficiency of 40 percent in areas where the US EPA 8- hour average ambient ozone standard is routinely exceeded. These devices should be operated continuously during times that the relevant air quality standard is exceeded and the building is occupied. See Air Quality Data Statistics or contact your local air quality management district to determine whether a specific site falls into this category. Purge buildings prior to daily occupancy with outdoor air, with either the minimum ventilation rate for one hour, or three complete air changes as required for non-residential buildings ( Section 120.1(c)2 of the 2013 California Code of Regulations , Title 24, Part 6 .) New and Renovated Buildings\n\nCommission new buildings to ensure proper installation and operation of all building systems, including the proper delivery of the required amount of outdoor air ( Title 24, Part 6, Section 120.8 ). Implement relevant mandatory measures and relevant and feasible voluntary measures from CALGreen (Division 5.5 and Appendix section A5.5). Provide specialized air treatment for buildings in areas where air quality standards are routinely exceeded. Use particulate matter air filters with a minimum MERV rating of 13. MERV 16 or HEPA (high efficiency particulate arrestance) filters should be considered where feasible for institutional residential buildings that house sensitive groups such as the elderly or infirm, and buildings used by children. Consider using ozone-removing air cleaning devices with a minimum volumetric ozone removal efficiency of 40 percent in areas where the US EPA 8-hour average ambient ozone standard is routinely exceeded. These devices should be operated continuously during times that the relevant air quality standard is exceeded and the building is occupied. See Air Quality Data Statistics to determine whether a specific site falls into this category. Specify that all HVAC systems above 2,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm) be equipped with outdoor airflow measuring stations and be connected to a building energy management system. Building management systems shall be programmed to provide audible and visible alarms when minimum outdoor airflow rates are not met. If feasible, HVAC systems smaller than 2,000 cfm shall also be equipped with such airflow measuring stations. Specify that all HVAC systems above 2,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm) be equipped with outdoor airflow measuring stations and be connected to a building energy management system. Building management systems shall be programmed to provide audible and visible alarms when minimum outdoor airflow rates are not met. If feasible, HVAC systems smaller than 2,000 cfm shall also be equipped with such airflow measuring stations. Develop an IEQ Construction Management Plan that incorporates measures in CALGreen Sections A5.504.1 through A5.504.2 for actions during and after construction to ensure healthful IEQ.\n\nStep 3: Prevent Water Intrusion and Growth of Mold\n\nKeep all buildings clean and sanitary as required by Title 8 Section 3362 Safe Practices and Personal Protection . When exterior water intrusion, leakage from interior water sources, or other uncontrolled accumulation of water occurs, the intrusion, leakage or accumulation shall be corrected, typically within 24-48 hours because these conditions may cause the growth of mold.\n\nStep 4: Line of Sight and Daylighting – New Buildings\n\nToplighting and sidelighting are recommended per CALGreen (Section A5.507.2); recommended are the use of light shelves, reflective room surfaces, means to eliminate glare, photosensor controls and not using diffuse daylighting glazing where views are desired. See New Buildings - Lighting and Lighting Design for additional information. Direct line of sight to the outdoor environment via vision glazing between 2.5 and\n\n7.5 feet above the finished floor in 90 percent of all regularly occupied areas is required. (CALGreen Section A5.507.3).\n\nStep 5: Input from Occupants – Existing Buildings\n\nInput from building occupants should be solicited every two years to obtain feedback on any IEQ and/or comfort concerns. One of the following methods should be used:\n\nOccupant surveys to collect information on IEQ, as well as on other sustainability issues, such as the need or desirability for electric vehicle charging stations, commute alternatives, etc. Maintenance and regular review of an occupant complaint database documenting complaints related to IEQ and response to the complaints."

Agencies shall provide online access to this data upon completion to the Department of General Services, Office of Sustainability, and notify upon completion to sustainability@dgs.ca.gov . Agencies may exclude process water from the annual reporting and water use reduction requirements. Also excluded is water used for fish and wildlife habitat, livestock maintenance, and firefighting. Annual usage will be measured against the baseline data previously reported by each state agency to determine if water reduction targets are met. Instructions for Leased Facilities New and renegotiated state leases shall include provisions for reporting water use where economically feasible. Agencies managing state-owned buildings are to report water usage. If agencies lease a building or space (state owned) managed by DGS, DGS will report the water use for that building space. If a state agency other than DGS manages the building or space, that agency will report the water use for that building. Estimating Water Use at Facilities without Water Meters\n\nIt is understood that not all state facilities can report actual water use, because metering or sub-metering is not available. This does not exempt these agencies/facilities from responsibility for active management of water consumption or reporting of water use. Baseline and ongoing water use can be estimated based on the water use ratings of fixtures and appliances at the site, the duration per use, amount of usage, and the number of occupants. Department of Water Resources Water Use Reduction Guidelines and Criteria document provides guidance on how to baseline water usage and report annual usage for facilities without meters.\n\nAgencies operating in these facilities should also apply Best Management Practices for Water Use, and document policies for purchasing/replacing water-using fixtures and/or equipment with higher efficiency models. If not cost prohibitive, state agencies should make water meter installations a priority so they can obtain accurate measurements of water use."

State agencies must implement the BMPs in the Water Use Reduction Guidelines and Criteria . State agencies are responsible to review and apply these BMPs to all facilities they occupy. Complete Building and Landscape Inventories: State agencies should complete a Building and Landscape Inventory every five years. The quantitative inventory requires a facility walk- through to assess the types, numbers and condition of all water using fixtures, appliances and irrigation equipment. Implement a Landscape Water Budget Program: Large landscape areas over 20,000 sq. ft. should be managed and water use tracked with a landscape water budget program. Large landscape water use often represents a significant percentage of a facility’s water use, and significant water savings can often be achieved through better irrigation scheduling or inexpensive improvements in irrigation hardware.

State agencies should reduce the amount of paper consumed by implementing paper waste prevention activities such as the use of electronic filing systems, setting printer defaults to duplex printing mode, and establishing paper reuse areas for one-sided paper. Many State agencies already have paper and cardboard recycling programs, because paper products comprise the greatest volume of recyclables for the typical office. The most common paper types generated in state offices are: white ledger (copier and printer paper), colored paper, newsprint, magazines, phone books and directories, paper bags, and cardboard. Mixed paper is what occurs when these commodities are not sorted. Sorting white paper from other types could produce revenue depending on the amount generated, market prices, and how well it is sorted. Some facilities mix paper and other recyclables into a single bin that is sorted at a material recovery facility. The single bin concept creates convenience for staff, but produces a lower grade of recycled paper that will produce little or no revenue. Recycling paper, even mixed paper, avoids disposal costs and helps agencies meet their 50% diversion requirement. These recycling programs also support the State of California’s 75% statewide waste diversion goal, in accordance with the provisions of AB 341 (2011) . For recycling non-confidential records, the shredded paper should be bagged to avoid litter.\n\nFor more information on paper waste prevention, reuse, and recycling: CalRecycle Paper\n\nFor more information on Confidential Records Destruction, see SAM 1600"

Depending on the quantity and quality of scrap metal generated, state agencies may receive revenue from recycling ferrous (sticks to a magnet, like steel & iron) and non- ferrous (aluminum, copper, brass, etc.) metal. Types of common scrap metal include: used wire, pipes, signs, posts, appliances, tin (steel) cans, empty aerosol and paint cans, rails and fencing, and some types of furniture. Agencies that generate significant amounts of scrap metal may choose to either sort out the most valuable types, or to commingle all types into one bin before sale to a scrap metal recycler.\n\nMetals are among the most valuable recycled commodities and they should be protected from theft.\n\nWhen it is recycled, scrap metal is generally exempt from hazardous waste regulations under both federal and state law. Scrap metal is not exempt from regulations under either federal or State Law when disposed, especially if it exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste or is contaminated with a listed hazardous waste. Such situations may include metals covered with old, leaded paint, or motor parts covered with oil and grease. In these cases, metal may need to be managed as a hazardous waste under federal law 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii) and state law 22 CCR 66261.6(a)(3)(B) ."

The Office of Risk and Insurance Management in these cases will notify the agency if it is still advisable to proceed with the claim and whether collection may be made on the basis of an estimate only. The Office of Risk and Insurance Management will notify the agency of the amount demanded from the third party. The agency will then recognize the claim as a contingent receivable.

        "content": "Overview SAM section 2800(B), Government Code Section 14850 and Penal Code Section 2807 require state agencies to obtain printing services from the Office of State Publishing (OSP) or the California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA), as directed by the California State Government Printing Services website: www.dgs.ca.gov/OSP/Resources/California-State-Government-Printing-Services . A state agency seeking to have print service work performed by a private sector printer or an in-plant (state agencies with in-house printing operations other than OSP or CALPIA) must obtain an exemption as specified in SAM Section 2811(B). Exemption requests are granted when it is not feasible for OSP or CALPIA to provide the requested printing services due to production, equipment, or other operational constraints. The use of a private sector printer must be justified by the agency under the provisions of Government Code Section 19130. OSP Exemption Process Except for those products identified in SAM Section 2850(C), state agencies must obtain an exemption from OSP prior to purchasing any print work from a source other than OSP, CALPIA or the agency’s own in-plant pursuant to SAM Section 2875. To request an exemption, a state agency shall submit a Printing Services Exemption Request (PSER) to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager at inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov with their agency’s designated OSP customer service representative copied (see SAM Section 2810(A) for customer service representative information). The agency must complete each section of the PSER in accordance with the provisions of the PSER Instructions document. (Electronic copies of the PSER and the PSER Instructions can be found on the California State Government Printing Services website: www.dgs.ca.gov/OSP/Resources/California-State-Government-Printing-Services ). The customer agency must allow OSP sufficient time to review the PSER, and, if the exemption is denied, to perform the print work. OSP will not consider exemption requests submitted less than thirty (30) calendar days before the due date identified on the PSER. However, OSP may waive this timeframe if an exemption is necessitated by extraordinary circumstances outside of an agency’s control, such as a response to a natural disaster. The Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager will communicate the decision on the exemption request to the customer. If the exemption is approved, the PSER will be returned to the customer with an OSP exemption number. If the exemption is denied, the customer will be referred to OSP, CALPIA, or a designated in-plant to complete the print work. A copy of the proposed interagency agreement or private sector printing contract must be sent to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager at inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov within thirty (30) days of the due date identified on the PSER. No private sector contract or interagency agreement for printing services (between a state agency and an in-plant) may be executed without an OSP-approved PSER (see SAM Section 2812 for information on interagency agreements for printing services.) For contracts requiring DGS Office of Legal Services (OLS) approval, a copy of the approved PSER must be submitted to DGS-OLS with the contract documents. Invoices for printing services submitted to the State Controller’s Office (SCO) without an OSP-approved PSER will not be processed. CALPIA exclusive products identified in SAM Section 2850(C) do not require an OSP exemption. State agencies must obtain an exemption from CALPIA before procuring these products from a private sector vendor. CALPIA Exemption Process for CALPIA Exclusive Products SAM Section 2850(C) lists certain print products that have been designated as exclusive to CALPIA and are not produced or offered by OSP. To obtain any of these products through a private sector vendor, a state agency must obtain an exemption from CALPIA prior to contracting for the print services. Information about CALPIA’s exemption process can be found on the CALPIA website: https://www.calpia.ca.gov/about/doing-business-with-calpia/exemption-process/ Pay Warrants Pay warrants and warrant-related printing produced by the State Controller’s Office (SCO) are not classified as print products subject to SAM Chapter 2800. SCO warrant printing does not require an OSP exemption nor rate approval by the State Printer (see SAM Section 2875(E)). Sales Tax Pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code 6006, sales tax must be applied and itemized separately on procurement documents for printing services obtained from a private sector printer."

        "title": "STATE AGENCY IN-PLANT PRINTING OPERATIONS",
        "content": "Definition An agency in-plant printing operation (hereinafter “in-plant”) is any state agency (state government office, department, division, bureau, board, or commission) which: 1) owns and/or operates one or more pieces of printing equipment, where a piece of equipment is valued at $50,000 or more at the time of acquisition; or, 2) employs one or more dedicated personnel under a printing trade classification (Bargaining Unit 14); and, 3) is not under the direct control of the State Printer. In-plants have also been referred to as “in-house printing and reproduction facilities” or “reproductive units.” Cost Recovery Pursuant to SAM Section 9210, it is state policy for departments to recover the full cost whenever goods and services are provided for others. Cost recovery is defined by SAM Section 9210 to include all costs attributable directly to the activity, plus a fair share of indirect costs which can be ascribed reasonably to the good or service provided. As defined in SAM Section 9211, indirect costs (or overhead costs) are the mandatory support costs (such as statewide Pro-Rata, departmental overhead, program overhead and FI$Cal) which are accumulated and allocated annually to the organizational units which benefit from the support. Pursuant to SAM Section 9210, each in-plant must account for its share of its agency’s overhead costs. Operating Authority In-plants shall only produce print work for their own agency (defined as the office, department, division, bureau, board or commission that purchased and/or operates the equipment), unless otherwise authorized by the Office of State Publishing (OSP). In-plants are only permitted to provide print work for other state agencies when the requesting agency has obtained OSP’s approval on a Printing Services Exemption Request (PSER) (see SAM Section 2811 for exemption procedure). An OSP-approved PSER must be included with all interagency agreements for in-plant printing services (see SAM Section 2812(B)). In-plants may not submit a PSER on behalf of another agency. OSP publishes a directory of in-plants authorized to provide print work for other state agencies on the OSP website at: https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OSP/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-State-Publishing-Resources-List-Folder/In-plant-operations. Before OSP will authorize an exemption for the in-plant to produce print work for another state agency, the in-plant must provide its services list (see SAM Section 2875(D)) and rate spreadsheet (see SAM Section 2875(E)) to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager at inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov for review and approval by the State Printer. The in-plant must have a current In-Plant Printing Operations Report (IPPOR) (see SAM Section 2875(F)) on file with the State Printer before OSP will authorize the in-plant to perform work for a customer agency. Services List In-plants that provide services to other state agencies must submit a list of all printing and reproduction services provided by the in-plant to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager at inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov . OSP will refer to this list when reviewing PSERs from customer agencies to determine whether the in-plant can complete the required print work. Any modifications to the services list should be provided to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager by email. The in-plant must provide an updated services list each year by September 1. Rates Development In-plants that provide printing services to other state agencies must establish an hourly rate for each piece of printing equipment operated to ensure that the printing operation is adequately recovering its costs (pursuant to SAM Section 9210). In-plants that are not providing printing services to other agencies are not required to establish rates. In-plants should use the Rate Development Spreadsheet (RDS) in developing their rates. The agency must complete the RDS in accordance with the provisions of the RDS Instructions document. The rates must be certified by the agency’s Deputy Administrative Director (no designee signature will be accepted) by electronic signature on the Certification section of the RDS. The RDS should be submitted by the agency’s Deputy Administrative Director to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager at inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov for review and approval by the State Printer. The State Printer may reject any rate structure that does not fully recover the cost of operation In-plants must update their rates annually to reflect changes in overhead and operational costs each fiscal year. Each year’s rates should be submitted to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager by email for review and approval by September 1. Electronic copies of the RDS and the RDS Instructions can be found on OSP’s website at: https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OSP/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-State-Publishing-Resources-List-Folder/In-Plant-Operations . Annual Operations Reporting Requirement State agencies that operate in-plants are required to provide an annual report detailing their printing operations to the State Printer. The agencies must use the State Printer’s In-Plant Printing Operations Report (IPPOR) to fulfill this requirement. The agency must complete each section of the IPPOR in accordance with the provisions of the IPPOR Instructions document.\n\nThe IPPOR must be certified by the agency’s Deputy Administrative Director (no designee signature will be accepted) by electronic signature on the Certification section of the IPPOR.\n\nThe IPPOR must be submitted electronically by the agency’s Deputy Administrative Director to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager at inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov by February 1 each year. If the State Printer requires corrections or additional information, the corrected IPPOR must also be certified and submitted electronically by the Deputy Administrative Director to inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov . Electronic copies of the IPPOR and the IPPOR Instructions can be found on OSP’s website at: https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OSP/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-State-Publishing-Resources-List-Folder/In-Plant-Operations.\n\nThe provisions of SAM Section 2875 do not apply to the printing operations enabled under Penal Code Section 2807."

        "content": "A. Overview\n\nNo state agency may acquire printing equipment, including, but not limited to, offset printing, digital printing, or bindery equipment, where a piece of equipment is valued in excess of $50,000, without prior approval from the State Printer.\n\nAgencies seeking to acquire new or replacement printing equipment are required to submit a Printing Equipment Acquisition Request (PEAR) (see SAM Section 2876(B)) to the State Printer for approval. The agency should use the PEAR to demonstrate that the agency has the capacity to operate the printing equipment efficiently and cost-effectively, and that the acquisition and use of this equipment will not be unnecessary duplicative of OSP services (or those services provided by other state agency in-plant printing operations as authorized under SAM Section 2875). To assist with this analysis, a Recovery of Investment Template (RIT) (see SAM Section 2876(C)) must be included with the PEAR.\n\nThe agency submitting the PEAR must affirm that the print work performed on the equipment will only support the printing needs of the acquiring agency (referring to the office, department, division, bureau, board or commission that purchases and/or operates the equipment), and not that of other agencies, except when a Printing Services Exemption Request (PSER) has been approved by OSP (see SAM Section 2811 for OSP exemptions).\n\nThe agency must have a current In-Plant Printing Operations Report (IPPOR) (see SAM Section 2875(F)) on file with the State Printer before they may submit a PEAR for approval.\n\nAgencies that have delegations of procurement authority, issued by the Department of General Services’ (DGS) Procurement Division, are still required to submit and receive approval on a PEAR prior to exercising their delegated procurement authority.\n\nB. Printing Equipment Acquisition Request Information\n\nThe PEAR standardizes the acquisition analysis with regard to the acquisition of printing equipment across state agencies. To ensure that the acquisition of printing equipment is cost-effective, the agency submitting the PEAR must provide a detailed account of its recovery of investment and estimated acquisition, overhead, operation, and maintenance costs.\n\nThe agency must complete each section of the PEAR in accordance with the provisions of the PEAR Instructions document. T he PEAR must be signed by the agency’s Deputy Administrative Director and/or Procurement and Contracting Officer (no designee signature will be accepted).\n\nElectronic copies of the PEAR and the PEAR Instructions can be found on OSP’s website at: https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OSP/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-State-Publishing-Resources-List-Folder/In-plant .\n\nA PEAR will not be considered complete unless a complete and accurate RIT with supporting documentation is included.\n\nC. Recovery of Investment Template Information\n\nState printing operations must be budgeted for cost recovery (see SAM Section 9210 requiring departments that provide goods and services to fully recover their costs). An agency seeking to acquire printing equipment must be able to demonstrate that it can recover the cost of owning and operating that printing equipment over five years. The RIT is a detailed financial analysis tool used to evaluate whether the acquisition of printing equipment is a cost-effective investment.\n\nTo ensure that the agency can adequately recover its cost, the agency must complete a five-year fiscal analysis on the RIT in accordance with the provisions of the RIT instructions document. OSP will not accept a PEAR without a complete and accurate RIT.\n\nState agencies must depreciate all printing equipment according to the following schedule:\n\nTable 1 Cost of Equipment (Before sales tax) Depreciation Period FI$Cal Asset Profile ID $50,000 to $1,999,999 May be depreciated up to five years PRINT_EQUIP (STANDARD) $2,000,000 to $4,999,999 May be depreciated up to seven years PRINT_EQUIP (IND) Greater than $5,000,000 May be depreciated up to ten years PRINT_EQUIP (LRG IND)\n\nState agencies may not exceed the depreciation schedule indicated in Table 1, but may choose a lesser depreciation period at their discretion.\n\nElectronic copies of the RIT and the RIT instructions can be found on OSP’s website at https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OSP/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-State-Publishing-Resources-List-Folder/In-plant.\n\nD. Submitting the Printing Equipment Acquisition Request\n\nElectronic copies of the PEAR, the RIT, and supporting documentation (as needed) must be submitted by the agency’s Deputy Administrative Director and/or Procurement and Contracting Officer to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager at inplantopsmanager@dgs.ca.gov for review. OSP will not review a PEAR unless all sections of the PEAR and the RIT are filled out completely.\n\nThe PEAR and supporting documentation must be submitted to the State Printer for approval no less than ninety (90) days prior to the anticipated solicitation release date. If the agency intends to use one-time acquisition services from the DGS Procurement Division prior to the end of the fiscal year, the PEAR must be received by the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager no later than the first business day of February. Agencies are not permitted to enter into a purchasing contract for printing equipment until a signed PEAR approval has been returned by the State Printer.\n\nThe State Printer may approve the PEAR as written, provide conditional approval through the recommendation of alternative equipment, or reject the PEAR with explanation. When PEAR approval is received, the submitting agency will be required to provide the PEAR to: 1) the DGS Procurement Division (if one-time acquisition services are required); 2) the DGS Office of Legal Services (OLS) (if OLS contract review is required); and, 3) the SCO (included with the invoice for processing of payment). Non-compliance with the PEAR approval process may result in non-approval of the contract and non-payment of invoices.\n\nThe amount on the solicitation to acquire the printing equipment may not exceed 10% of the purchase price indicated on Section 4, Item 1 of the PEAR without secondary approval from OSP.\n\nApproval on a PEAR is valid for the duration of the fiscal year of issuance and the following fiscal year.\n\nElectronic copies of the Scope of Work issued with the solicitation and the final purchase agreement must be provided to the Statewide In-Plant Operations Manager within sixty (60) days of a signed purchase agreement .\n\nThe provisions of SAM Section 2876 do not apply to printing operations enabled under Penal Code Section 2807."

This program is being administered by the Department of General Services, Office of Procurement, within the framework of the Statewide Materials Management System or the Purchasing Information Network (PIN). The program started in November 1977 and will continue until all major agencies and warehousing facilities are participating. The Office of Procurement is responsible for establishing effective purchase methods for expendable items which provide a means to reduce the quantity and type of expendable items in State inventories. The Office of Procurement shall also recommend policies and procedures to reduce the State's expendable inventories investment, review agency materials management practices, recommend to agencies actions to achieve more effective materials management, and monitor and report on the progress of agency programs. Agency owned expendable goods inventories will continue to be managed by the owning agency and not by the Department of General Services. Inventory control systems used throughout the State will be standardized whenever possible. Basic statewide inventory management policy under which all agencies will operate is as follows: Funds used for the purchase of expendable goods inventories must be clearly identified in the support documents which are prepared to justify agency's respective portion of the Governor's Budget. See SAM Section 6120 . The information may be contained in the Schedule 2 (Line Item Budget) or Schedule 11 (Preparation of Supplementary Schedule of Operating Expenses). Other documentation may suffice, but funds used for the purchase of expendable goods must be clearly identified. This information will be made available to the Department of General Services, Office of Procurement, upon request by that entity. The Department of General Services, Office of Procurement, is responsible for establishing purchasing, warehousing, inventory control, and distribution methods which will minimize the State's need for the maintenance of supplies, warehouses, and inventories. The Department of General Services contracts with suppliers to deliver some materials directly to the point of use for State agencies. Other materials which require quality assurance testing or which, through volume purchasing, can be landed at one point and redistributed at a savings to the State, are purchased and redistributed by the Office of Procurement, Material Services.\n\nThe Office of Procurement, Material Services, is the central redistribution warehousing organization. Departments or agencies may maintain continuing inventories of supply items available from Material Services only at or near the point of use. Departments may not maintain redistribution warehouses to resupply point of use facilities unless authorized by the Department of General Services, Deputy Director, Office of Procurement.\n\nState agencies must maintain unit stock records and conduct annual physical inventories if they operate warehouses which aggregately meet any one of the following criteria:\n\n- Gross floor space exceeding 4,000 sq. ft.\n\n- Average annual inventory investment in expendable goods exceeding $50,000\n\n- Annual issues of expendable goods exceeding $100,000\n\n- Expendable goods inventory consisting of 400 or more stock items\n\nExpendable items will be maintained in continuing inventory only if they are:\n\n- Required for emergency needs involving public health, safety, or welfare\n\n- Not readily available from supplier inventories\n\n- Stable items with high demand and represent the low net cost purchase option\n\nAgency inventories and operating costs generated by the continuing maintenance of such inventories shall be no greater than is actually required or economically justified. Inventories will be subject to periodic audit by Department of General Services or other authorized audit units to assure that individual agency managers have regularly and effectively maintained such inventories at the lowest practical level.\n\nAgencies shall, within the general framework of this policy, develop and publish internal policies and procedures which must contain at least the following:\n\n- Specific assignment of management responsibility for effective materials management at both agency-wide level and within each organizational unit that maintains continuing inventories of expendable goods.\n\n- Policies and procedures governing the size and scope of continuing inventory investment, standards for utilization of storage space and review of materials management program effectiveness."

A single invoice received in such instances may be claimed by including the invoice in a claim schedule filed against one of the appropriations involved and putting an adequate cross-reference in the claim schedule filed against the other appropriation concerned. Frequent recurrence of such consolidated estimates may make it advisable to charge the encumbrances and expenditures for such items to a single appropriation in the first instance and subsequently recover the appropriate amount due from other appropriations by State Controller's transfer under a plan of financial adjustment as authorized by Government Code Section 11251 . However, this method presents the disadvantage of overstating the encumbered balance of the allotments to be charged under the plan until such time as the State Controller's transfer is formally requested. Agencies desiring to use the plan of financial adjustment method where substantial amounts are involved should consult the Department of Finance budget staff before doing so. See SAM Section 8456 ."

This is done by filing an exemption certificate with the order. (The Exemption Certificate, STD. 802 , is available from Department of General Services, Office of Procurement, Material Services Section.) At the same time, write across the face of the order, \"Exemption Certificate Attached\" and write on the Exemption Certificate the number of the order or sub- purchase order.\n\nTo find out what is normally subject to tax and the percentage of tax, refer to the \"Scope of Tax\" list. Then ask your supplier if his price includes excise tax. If so, determine the amount and deduct this from the price to establish the cost of the material less tax.\n\nOn purchases where the excise tax amounts to less than $0.50 (total) made from small dealers or merchants who are unfamiliar with the means by which they can obtain reimbursement, do not claim exemption. This also applies where automotive repairs are made in conjunction with the purchase of automotive parts and a State discount is allowed by the selling garage. However, a small merchant who does business with the State on a \"repeat\" basis on items subject to excise tax should be familiar with how he is able to get a refund by turning in the Exemption Certificate.

The analysis must be completed on the \"Lease Versus Purchase Analysis–Equipment\" form shown in the Appendix at the end of this chapter. Any assumptions which are peculiar to a given acquisition should be noted on the back of the form. If this format will not fit the particular situation, use some other logical analytical sequence. Use present value techniques when doing a lease/purchase analysis. Submit one copy. If you have questions or need help working on the analysis, call the Research and Analysis Unit of the DGS Office of Procurement. A completed sample form is provided in the Appendix. See SAM Section 3740 for instructions on completing the sample form.\n\nDo a lease/purchase analysis when arranging to rent certain equipment. In this case, submit the analysis with the contract to the DGS Office of Legal Services . This analysis must be in the same format.\n\nThe lease/purchase cost comparison views the purchase of equipment as an investment. Therefore, the basic issue is if the rental and other costs that are saved by investing in (purchasing) the equipment will provide an adequate return on investment. This approach compares the purchase price with the present value of the series of payments and other costs that are saved when the equipment is purchased. The present value (discounted cash flow) concept is based on the time value of money. It considers the fact that the dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because of its earnings potential. If the value of money is 9.479 percent annually, then $100 a year from now is worth $91.34 today; i.e., $91.34 x 1.09479 = $100.\n\nEven when your lease/purchase analysis indicates that purchasing is more desirable, the best alternative for the State may be to lease or lease with an option to buy. This is most often true if any of the following conditions exist:\n\nTrying out the system for a while before buying it. The system's design is new and untried.

Is the cost of keeping the equipment in good working condition the same for each alternative? If not, include the maintenance costs in the present value calculations. Deduct the maintenance costs from lease costs, or add them to the purchase price for proper analysis.\n\nPurchase Options. If the lease gives an option to buy the equipment, how will using this option affect the total cost? Also, when is it least costly to use the purchase option, and when will using the option cost more than the cash purchase price?\n\nUseful Life of the Equipment. There are two ways to look at how long equipment will be useful. One way is, how long will the equipment be needed for the program it will support? The second way is, how long will the equipment last before it wears out? Check with the equipment vendor to see if the equipment can last as long as needed. The DGS has set the useful life of office copiers at five to seven years depending on workload categories and word processing equipment at seven years.\n\nSalvage Value. When the equipment will last longer than the need for it, include an estimate of the equipment's salvage value in your cost analysis.\n\nOpportunity Cost. Figure out how much money would be earned over the same period of time if the money was invested in something else other than the purchase. Use the interest rate of 9.479 percent to compute present value.\n\nOther Items. Be sure to consider other items that are unique to the proposal when making the lease/purchase analysis."

Any other incurred costs. —From the vendor.\n\n3. Useful life of the equipment. Determine how long the equipment is needed based on the length of the program. From the vendor, find out how long the equipment should last.\n\n4. Estimated salvage value when the equipment is no longer needed. This value is only needed if the equipment will outlast the program. Estimate this value with help from the vendor and/or the DGS Office of Procurement.\n\nComplete the lease/purchase analysis on the Lease Versus Purchase Analysis– Equipment Form, GSOP 176 , shown in the Appendix at the end of this chapter.. This form uses the three most common ways to figure present value.\n\n1. Discounted cash flow. 2. Amortized cost. 3. Break-even point.\n\nThe following information is given to help explain these three present value techniques. It also serves as an example for filling out the form's three sections.\n\nFiguring out the Discounted Cash Flow. Use this method to compare the total cost of leasing to the total cost of purchasing. This method allows for the time value of money, based upon the premise that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because of earnings potential. If the value of money is 9.479 percent annually, then $100 a year from now is worth $91.34 today; i.e., 1.09479 x $91.34 = $100. Thus you can find out if it is less expensive to postpone the payments until some future time by leasing, or make the entire payment right away by purchasing. The eleven items under Computation of Discounted Cash Flow in the example shown in the Appendix were computed as follows: 1. Purchase price = $8,000. (When rental credits can be applied, the amount subtracted from the purchase price should be stated.) 2. The following purchase costs: a. Maintenance if purchased: $50 per month (indicate period). Monthly table for Present Value of Annuity of $1 for 96 months (useful life) shows a factor of 68.04: $50 x 68.04 = $3,402 b. Sales tax of six percent on $8,000 = $480. c. Any other costs should be shown. Items 2a, 2b and 2c are then subtotaled. 3. Purchase price and subtotaled purchase costs are combined to produce a total purchase cost; i.e., $8,000 + $3,882 = $11,882. 4. Subtract the following if the equipment will last longer than your program: a. Estimate of salvage value. b. The Present Value of $1 for the periods of your program's life. Find this value in the tables in the Appendix. c. Salvage value is multiplied by the Present Value of $1 figure to give you the present value of the salvage value. 5. Subtract the salvage value (none in this example) from Total Purchase Costs to give you the Net Purchase Costs, which remain $11,882. 6. Lease payment per month (indicate period) = $350. 7. Add the following costs for leasing over the same length of time as line 6 above. a. The maintenance contract is included in this lease but should be shown if separate. b. Sales tax of six percent on $350 = $21. c. Any other costs should be shown. Subtotal these lease costs. 8. Add the lease payment and subtotaled lease costs to get the Total Lease Payment; i.e., $350 + $21 = $371. 9. The monthly table (periods must match) for the Present Value of Annuity of $1 for 96 periods (useful life) shows a factor of 68.04. 10. The present value of the lease is computed by multiplying the total lease payment by the factor for the Present Value of Annuity of $1; i.e., $371 x 68.04 = $25,243. 11. Compare the Net Purchase Cost with the Present Value of the Lease. Subtract the smaller amount from the larger amount; i.e., $25,243 minus $11,882 = $13,361. The number on line 11 shows the amount that can be saved by choosing the less costly option. In this example the purchase is less costly. Computation of Amortized Cost. Use this method to compare the cost of leasing and purchasing on a monthly basis (or some other regular period). A sum of money today is converted to a series of equal payments for a given number of times. This follows the same principle as an installment loan. The three items under Computation of Amortized Costs in the example shown in the Figures Appendix were computed as follows: 12. The monthly table for the Annuity Whose Present Value is $1 for the period of the useful life (96 months) shows a factor of .8147. 13. Multiply the net purchase costs shown on line 5 by the factor shown on line 12. This gives you the amortized cost of purchase; i.e., $11,882 x .8147 = $175, which equals the monthly cost of purchase over the period of the useful life. 14. Compare the Total Lease Payment (line 8) with the Amortized Cost of Purchase (line 13). Subtract the smaller amount from the larger amount; i.e., $371 minus $175= $196.\n\nThe number on line 14 shows the amount that can be saved per period by choosing the lesser option. In this example the purchase is less costly.\n\nComputation of Break-even Point. Use this method to figure out when the leasing costs equal the purchase price. This method allows for the effect of interest. In order to figure out the break-even point, any maintenance costs that are included in the purchase price or lease payment must be removed. The four items under Computation of Break-even Point in the example shown in the Figures Appendix are computed as follows: 15. Subtract the maintenance cost for purchased equipment (line 2A) from net purchase costs (line 5). This gives you the total purchase cost without maintenance; i.e., $11,882 minus $3,482 = $8,480. 16. Write down the maintenance costs per period which are included in the lease payment (see line 2A). Then subtract this amount from the lease payment (line 8); i.e., $371 minus $50 = $321. 17. Divide the purchase costs (line 15) by the lease payment (line 16). This gives you the present value factor; i.e., $8,480 divided by $321 = $26.42. 18. Find the factor now shown in line 17 on the appropriate period table for the Present Value of Annuity of $1 found on the Department of General Services, Procurement Division, State Financial Marketplace webpage . Line 18 shows the break-even point; i.e., the point in time when lease costs equal purchase costs. When the useful life exceeds the break-even point, as in the above example, it is less costly to purchase the equipment. If the useful life is shorter than the break-even point, it is cheaper to lease the equipment. In our example, the break-even point is at 30 months. Most Economical Method of Acquisition. In the case of our example, the most economical method of acquisition is \"purchase.\" Therefore, check the purchase box on line 19."

        "title": "LEASE WITH OPTION TO PURCHASE",
        "content": "Evaluation of the Option to Purchase. It may be best to lease with an option to purchase instead of regular lease or purchase. A lease with an option to purchase is like a regular lease but it gives the right to purchase the equipment at some time before all of the lease payments have been made. This alternative may be best when it is necessary or advantageous to proceed with the acquisition of the equipment that meets system specifications, but it is desirable to temporarily postpone a decision to purchase. This may be the case when an agency wants to try the system out for a short while to first prove the validity of the system design. This is especially the case when there is no previous experience with the system, or when decisions which might substantially alter the system specifications are imminent.\n\nThe possibility that future advances in technology will render the selected equipment comparatively obsolete before the cost advantage point (see break-even analysis) is reached should not stop an agency from purchasing the equipment as long as the equipment is able to satisfy their requirements.\n\nEvaluate the above considerations against the costs associated with postponing the decision to purchase. This cost is determined as follows:\n\n[(Purchase price–rental credits towards purchase) x Present Value of $l] – [Price– (Present Value of Annuity of $1 x lease payment)]\n\nExample:\n\nFor this example, assume the same facts as in the sample form and instructions used in SAM Section 3740, and also assume the following:\n\n100 percent of the first three months of rental is credited toward the purchase. After the first three months, 50 percent of the monthly rental payments is credited toward the purchase. Payments are credited up to a maximum of 50 percent of total payments. The decision to purchase will be postponed for one year.\n\nThe cost of postponing the decision to purchase is determined as follows:\n\nPurchase price = $8,000 Total rental payments for one year = $4,200 Rental credits: Months 1–3 = $1,050 Months 4–12 = $1,575 Total = $2,625 50 percent of total rental payments = $2,100 Credit allowance = $2,100 Cost = ($8,000–$2,100) x .9134172* $8,000–(11.4294263** x 350) ($5,900 x .9134172)–($8,000–$4,000) $5,389–$4,000 $1,389 = cost of postponing decision to purchase\n\n* See tables for monthly payments Present Value of $1.\n\n** See tables for monthly payments Present Value of Annuity of $1.\n\nCompare the cost of postponing the decision of whether to purchase (as determined above) with the advantages of postponing the decision in order to gather additional information. When the desired equipment has been used or tested by other units, there is generally little need to further test the equipment."

        "content": "Review any equipment that is acquired under a lease when the conditions that lead to the lease decision have substantially changed, or may soon change. Frequently, there are changes in the projected useful life. For example, the useful life of the equipment may change with increased workload volume. These changes alter the balance between lease versus purchase costs. At such times the equipment lease/purchase should be reviewed by using the lease/purchase analysis, using the same format as the original lease/purchase analysis. Generally, vendors allow credits of rental payments toward the purchase. Adjust the purchase price accordingly."

        "content": "You must ensure that your routing of State freight is handled objectively and economically. In keeping with Government Code Section 14920 , you must adhere to the following policies. General Policy Statement. The mode and carrier you select must be able to reliably and safely transport the freight within your required time frame, and at the lowest delivered cost. You must know the carrier's liability under applicable freight tariffs for full or released valuation. You must also consider the efficient use of the nation's transportation resources, especially fuel consumption. Legal Requirements. You can only select a carrier that has the proper operating authority and complies with all regulatory requirements. The carrier must: Have the proper operating authority with the necessary regulatory agency. The carrier is only allowed to serve those areas authorized in its operating authority. Have published or be served with the proper tariffs for the goods to be transported and points to be served. Have the necessary insurance required by government agencies. Upon request, the carrier must provide, through its insurance broker, active certificates of insurance. Agree to perform the transportation at the lowest lawful rates. Service Requirements. In evaluating a carrier consider satisfactory service as a key consideration. You must be able to establish that the carrier can transport the State freight not only the first time, but also on a continuing basis. This means the carrier must be able to deliver the entire shipment to the place it is needed, when it is needed, and in usable condition. Find out if the carrier has suitable equipment available. Also consider the carrier's record of performance. Use the following essential factors when you evaluate a carrier's service standards: Carrier always picks up and delivers on schedule. Carrier's equipment is always clean, safe, weatherproof, and able to meet the needs of the State. Carrier can furnish adequate equipment and drivers when needed. Carrier's drivers are clean, sober, and sufficiently experienced. Carrier's drivers and supporting employees must be paid the industry's prevailing wage rates. Carrier's terminal facilities must be suitable. Carrier must have adequate experience in the transportation field in serving accounts with requirements similar to those of State shippers. If a carrier has fewer than two years operating experience transporting the same type of freight, you must get evidence of the carrier's satisfactory service to other accounts transporting goods similar to the type and volume normally required by your agency. Carrier must demonstrate the ability to properly and accurately rate and bill the shipments according to the right tariffs. Carrier must have experienced minimal loss, damage, or theft of shipments. Carrier must display the ability to promptly and fairly handle claims for freight loss and damage. Carrier's response to overcharge claims must be fair and prompt. (Continued)\n\nDelivered Cost. When two or more carriers or modes can equally meet the above service requirements, you must select the carrier providing the lowest total delivered cost. Equitable Distribution. It is the State's policy to encourage participation by various business enterprises in all areas of State procurements, including transportation services. Follow the guidance of the State Contracting Manual for goals, preferences and incentives. Unsatisfactory Carrier Service. If you can't satisfactorily resolve problems caused by a carrier's failure to meet the State's service requirements, you should report the problem in writing to the DGS\n\nTransportation Management Unit\n\n. The DGS Transportation Management Unit may recommend punitive action against the carrier after a careful review of all the facts."

You can transport State-owned uncrated furniture, fixtures, and equipment between cities within California by using padded van carriers that specialize in moving new furniture or used household goods. State property that is protectively packed in cartons or crates may be transported at much less cost by general freight carriers. Linehaul rates of household goods carriers, which include inside pickup and inside delivery subject to extra charges for long carries, stairs, and elevators, are the most costly and do not include any packing labor and materials. To avoid mandatory carrier- assessed valuation charges, orders for transportation by household goods carriers must specify in writing \"Shipper hereby releases the entire shipment to a value not exceeding 60 cents per pound per article.\" For intercity transportation by any of these types of carriers, use an appropriate PUC licensed carrier at rates not to exceed PUC minimum rates based on weight and distance. Before the move you should have a clear understanding with the carrier that charges will be assessed against actual weight as shown by the public weighmaster's certificate(s). Local or Hand Moves. You may use any of the following methods to get a contractor for a move within a building or between buildings in the same metropolitan area. However, you may only lawfully hire PUC licensed carriers for moves that involve transportation over the public streets and highways.\n\nYou may use the DGS Procurement Division Master Service Agreement contracts. The Master Service Agreements are designed for small moves. You can also use the Master Service Agreements for larger moves when the administrative effort to prepare a bid, conduct a walk-through for bidders, and develop a separate contract is not warranted. You may also use the Master Service Agreements for moves that cannot be clearly defined at walk-through for prospective bidders. Take full advantage of the DGS Procurement Division Master Service Agreements that provide low hourly rates for experienced help and equipment. The time chargeable to your job is clearly defined. Charges for packing containers are set. The contractor is properly insured and specially bonded. The contractor also agrees to meet the prevailing wage requirements of Government Code Section 14920 . When using this Master Service Agreement, you should: Ensure persons arranging moves receive copies of the Master Service Agreement. If you have trouble getting a copy, you can get one from the DGS Transportation Management Unit. Provide the contractor with two working days notice. Indicate your agency's five- digit billing codes on your work orders.Contract hourly rates do not apply to work performed on federal holidays. Expedite payment of bills for work done under the Master Service Agreement. Submit written reports to the DGS Transportation Management Unit of any incidents where the contract moving company fails to perform under the Master Service Agreement. You may go out for competitive bid for specifically defined work for a lump sum amount. If you cannot define the work at a walk-through conducted for prospective bidders, you may get bids for services at hourly rates. Bid contracts can be up to one year in length. Use the following outline of procedures to obtain competitive lump sum bids. Use similar procedures in preparing bids and contracts for services at hourly rates. Invite at least three PUC licensed local moving companies to attend a one-time walk-through.Hand out specifications and bid proposal forms.Explain and show all work (including cartons) at the origin and destination that is to be included in the lump sum bid. Advise bidders of tentative dates and hours of the move.State if the move needs to take place during or after normal working hours. Notify moving company representatives that the winning bidder must sign a Standard Agreement, STD. 213 , and that the mover will be charged with repair or replacement of damage to building or any items lost, damaged, or stolen while in the carrier's custody.See (3800) A–1 in the Appendix. To avoid misunderstandings on major jobs, you must get sealed bids.Open them publicly at a set time and date. On small jobs, all of the movers can submit bids at the same time immediately after the walk-through. You must make the award to the lowest responsible bidder. Use Standard Agreement, STD. 213 , with appropriate specifications for contracting lump sum work. For help with contract specifications, contact the DGS Transportation Management Unit. You must include the following paragraph about prevailing wages in any competitive bid contract and bid specifications for commercial moving. Prevailing Wages No contractor performing hereunder shall pay any employee actually engaged in the moving and handling of goods being relocated under such contract less than the prevailing wage rate, except in geographical areas where no such employee wage standards and conditions are reasonably available. The term \"prevailing wage rate\" means the rate paid to a majority of workmen engaged in the particular craft, classification or type of work within the locality if a majority of such workmen be paid at a single rate; if there be no single rate being paid to a majority, then the rate being paid the greater number. Upon written request wage rates prevailing at the particular point in time will be furnished for information purposes only. When you receive written requests from prospective bidders or contractors for prevailing wage rates, you must convey in writing the need for the desired wage rate information to the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Statistics and Research. The geographical areas in which the moving services are to be performed must be included in your request. You must include any required goals, preferences or incentives in your contracting process.\n\nSee SAM Section 1200 for contract requirements. Old Office Records. See SAM Section 1684. Records in record center boxes shipped in volume to or from State Records Centers, or elsewhere, should be transported as general freight. Describe the shipment as follows: Old office records, each package released to a value not exceeding 3 1/2 cents per pound. DGS contracts with small parcel delivery services carriers are the least costly and should be used for small shipments of old office records."

The agency should give you the State's List of Eligible Carriers and the DGS Moving Guide.These are essential to a well planned move.These two items are available from the DGS Transportation Management Unit. Next you select a household goods carrier from the list. Then get an accurate written estimate of weight and costs from the carrier. Where no eligible carrier is available, you may ask your agency to have the DGS Transportation Management Unit negotiate a contract with a carrier. You must obtain the signature of the carrier's agent in Part II of STD. 255. This signature, along with your signature, binds the carrier to do the move according to its offer and at the rates on file with the state. Give the original STD. 255 to the carrier, retain one copy, and forward the other copy directly to the DGS Transportation Management Unit, 707 Third Street, Second Floor, West Sacramento, CA 95605- 2811. Your agency will give you a stamped, self-addressed envelope for this purpose. All household goods shipped under STD. 255 are automatically insured for loss or damage under the state's blanket insurance policy. The use of individual certificates or policies is not needed.This blanket insurance applies only on transportation within California or transportation between two points in California by an interstate route.\n\nThe blanket insurance provides coverage at $2.00 valuation per pound of household goods shipped subject to the authorized weight. See CCR, Title 2, Section 599.719 and SAM Section 3823. In some cases, you may believe that the actual value of the goods is more than the amount of insurance provided by the state. If you want more coverage than provided by the State, you can buy your own additional insurance from your insurance agent at your expense.\n\nShipments and authorized weights will be reported to the insurance company by the DGS Office of Risk and Insurance Management . This will be based upon the DGS Transportation Management Unit's analysis of freight bills. Agencies are billed monthly by the insurance company.\n\n4. The State's insurance has deductibles of $250 for loss or damage while in transit via a household goods carrier.\n\nWhen you pay part or all of a deductible, you may get a refund from your employing agency on a Travel Expense Claim form, STD. 262 . When submitting this claim, you must furnish:\n\nA copy of the original claim filed with the household goods carrier for moves other than self moves. Documentation of the amount paid by the household goods carrier and the State's insurance company.\n\nSee the Moving Guide for a detailed description of the insurance coverage, as well as instructions on how to file a claim."

Generally permanent residences can be found within 60 days. Therefore the state will usually only pay for relocation expenses for up to 60 days. Exceptions to this are only approved in rare instances. If you want to apply for an extension because of an unusual and unavoidable hardship you may submit your request on a STD. 256 . Send a STD.256, along with an explanation of the hardship, to the Department of Personnel Administration, Personnel Services Branch, 1515 S Street, North Building, Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95814. The following requirements must be satisfied in order to receive an extension for relocation: Request early. You must submit your request before the 60 days are up. This is a statutory requirement. The DPA may not approve after-the-fact requests. Hardship as a result of the move. The employee must prove that a hardship exists and that it is a direct result of the move. The hardship must be more than an inconvenience. Unusual circumstance. The situation must be uncommon or rare to relocation. Normal delays in processing or completing the move will not be considered. For example, if a house does not complete escrow in the 60 days, an exception will not be granted. Since escrow usually takes 30 to 60 days, this is not uncommon. However, if an unusual event directly caused the delay in the close of escrow, an extension may be granted. An example might be a death in the seller's family. If this delayed the seller from vacating the house, an exception may be granted. Unforeseeable circumstance. The delay must be unavoidable or unforeseeable prior to acceptance of the transfer. Further, the delay must be beyond the control of the employee. Consider such items as the housing market, advancement at the new location, increased income, cost of living at the new location, and the family status at the time of the relocation prior to accepting the transfer. The DPA staff will review the employee's efforts to locate a residence. Even if all requirements are satisfied, the employee must document that every reasonable effort was made to step up the process of locating a new residence. Examples of problems that have been denied in the past and will be denied in the future are as follows:\n\nPurchasing a house under construction or to be constructed. This is a personal decision of the employee's.An extension will not be granted for this reason. Areas with an obvious lack of available houses. Employees should examine the housing situation and make a decision accordingly when considering a transfer to cities that have an obvious lack of housing. The employee assumes the risk of a delay in locating a residence. Unable to sell the old residence. The legislation clearly only permits reimbursement of relocation expenses for finding a new home, not for selling an old one. Delays in selling the old home will not be considered. Damage to new home is found while in escrow. When purchasing a home, it is the buyer's duty to inspect the structure for damage. Later, if problems are found, it is the employee's responsibility, not the state's. An extension of per diem or storage allowance will not be granted."

Check the freight to see if it is the same as described on the delivery receipt.Look at the label on each item to make sure the shipment belongs to you. Is it damaged? Do not sign the receipt before inspecting for damage. Check for holes, water, stains, and tears. Pick up cartons if you can. Check for rattling. Listen for something broken inside. Check to see if any packages have been opened or if the sealing tape has been tampered with. Is the piece count correct? Count the pieces and match the number on the delivery receipt to the number you have counted. If the shipment is on a pallet, check to make sure the pallet is solid with no voids inside the stack. If the shipment is shrink or stretch wrapped, make sure the wrap hasn't been cut and pieces removed. Sign only for the type of unit you receive. For example: two pallets. Don't sign for the number of packages that are supposed to be on the pallet. However, if time permits or the pallet is not banded or shrink wrapped, count the packages, and only then sign for the number of packages. If your delivery doesn't check out, do one of the following: Refuse shipment if it isn't yours, if the shipment does not meet the terms specified by your agency, or is damaged to the point where it no longer has a value. If yours, and only partially damaged or short, accept it and note exceptions on the delivery receipt. How to note exceptions:\n\nDamage Notations: Be specific. Describe the damage accurately. Pinpoint the locations of all defects. If you can see the damage, have the driver wait while you open and inspect the packages. Write down the number and identity of the damaged pieces.This is called a \"joint inventory.\" Shortage Notations: If part of shipment is missing, write the number of pieces actually delivered on the delivery receipt and circle it. Then write down the number of pieces missing and note them as \"short.\" Signatures: Write down all exceptions on both copies of the delivery receipt. Have the driver sign both copies of the delivery receipt in his full name (not initials or nicknames). After the driver signs, you sign also. Write your agency's name, your full name, the date, and the time of day.\n\nFollow these steps when requesting an inspection:\n\nThe receiving person is responsible for requesting the carrier to inspect the damaged goods and packaging. The formal request should be made by phone right after discovering any loss or damage. After the phone request, make out a request for inspection by the carrier in writing. Note the date and time of your previous phone call and the person contacted. Keep a copy of your request letter on file. Once contacted about damage or shortage, the carrier may waive inspection and tell you so. If so, write down the name of the person who waived the inspection, and the date and time of waiver. Then conduct your own detailed inspection. Write up your findings in a report and attach it to the file. If you can, take photographs to confirm your inspection report."

See SAM Section 3801 for the PUC definitions of split pickups and deliveries. You must prepay all charges for split delivery shipments. The carrier may not collect charges of any nature from any consignee. You cannot ship more than 40 delivery components per shipment. If the components average less than 1,000 pounds per delivery component or exceed 20 components per master bill, you will be charged extra. In addition to the component parts picked up by the carrier, a split pickup shipment may include other component parts delivered to a carrier's depot by the consignor or the consignor's agent. Each shipment will be limited to 40 pickup components. Additional charges are made when the components average less than 1,000 pounds per pickup component or exceed 20 components per master bill. Often you can save a great deal of money on shipments by using split delivery or split pickup service. In cases where individual shipment lots are for delivery to points grouped in the same general geographic area, or the movement is in the same general direction over a carrier's freight route, you should consider consolidating and shipping the lots in a single split shipment. Contact the DGS Transportation Management Unit for assistance. Lots must be handed over to the carrier at one time on one shipping document. The tariff requirement reads as follows:\n\nAt the time of or prior to the initial pickup of any portion of the shipment, an appropriate written document is issued by the consignor for each component part, said document containing all of the information required to prepare a bill of lading in compliance with provisions of Item 360 of the Governing Classification. In addition, the consignor shall provide the carrier with a single document containing written information setting forth in summary, the total numbers and kind of packages, description of articles, and total weight of all commodities described on the bills of lading for each component part. Said document shall also reflect total number of pieces and total weight of all commodities in the shipment and must make reference, by number or other individual identity, to each bill of lading issued for a component part."

DGS Transportation Management Unit will verify the rates on the freight bills against the tariffs. The DGS Transportation Management Unit will obtain adjustments of any overcharges for you. Under certain special circumstances, commercial carriers may grant the government less than tariff rates. Carriers quoting government rates may be subject to certain regulatory constraints. All such negotiations should be cleared through DGS Transportation Management Unit. When using government rates, add the following sentences to the shipping documents: \"Freight is for the account of the State of California. Transportation hereunder pursuant to (cite carrier and tender number).\" Contracts and purchase orders must instruct vendors to also place this sentence on the bill of lading issued to the carrier. Contact DGS Transportation Management Unit for availability of government rates on shipments starting from or destined to points outside of California. The DGS Transportation Management Unit will verify the rates on the freight bills against the tariffs and obtain adjustments for any overcharges on your behalf. Shipments via Air Carriers. Air carriers have been deregulated. Air cargo rates fluctuate and are negotiable. Call DGS Transportation Management for help when air freight is required.\n\nShipments via Contract and Exempt Surface Carriers. Contract carriers and exempt carriers do not have to charge any fixed rates. Contact the DGS Transportation Management Unit for assistance before using such carriers. Routing Guides. If you are going to use a commercial carrier, you should consult with the DGS Transportation Management Unit to see which carrier and route will give you the best balance of low cost and responsiveness to needs of shippers and consignees. Where appropriate, the DGS Transportation Management Unit will develop routing guides and will issue bulletins on procedures to follow for freight routing. Carrier Operating Authority. If you are unsure of the category of a particular carrier, ask the carrier to give you the information in regard to the type of hauling involved. Do not use carriers who do not have the required operating authority from the California or Federal regulatory agencies. Call DGS Transportation Management Unit if you have any questions about this."

Additionally, departments are authorized to use the State Fleet Fuel Card for long-term commercial vehicle rentals through the state’s commercial car rental contract. A long-term commercial rental is defined as a vehicle rental of 30 calendar days or more that has been approved by DGS Office of Fleet & Asset Management (OFAM).\n\nAllowable Purchases\n\nAs authorized by a department, the State Fleet Fuel Card may be used to purchase the following items when conducting official state business:\n\nRegular-grade unleaded gasoline and diesel.

        "content": "(Renumbered from 4144 and Revised 10/2019)\n\nDEFINITION OF VHSP\n\nA VHSP is required for any employee who stores a state vehicle at or in the vicinity of his/her home on a frequent basis as defined by CCR, Title 2, Section 599.808 (d) .\n\nSection 599.808 (d) requires the Department of General Services (DGS) to prescribe the rules and procedures relating to the home storage of state vehicles as well as to review and approve VHSPs at DGS’ discretion.\n\nOVERVIEW The Department of General Services (DGS) requires that vehicle home storage permits (VHSPs) issued by state agencies shall adhere to policies outlined in section VHSP Requirements and meet the criteria of essential or cost effective permits as noted in section Criteria for Essential & Cost-Effective Permits . DGS requires the use of criteria that augment those provided in the CCR, Title 2, Section 599.808. Further, agencies shall use the revised STD 377 , Vehicle Home Storage Permit/Request Form when requesting vehicle home storage permits.\n\nStorage of state-owned mobile equipment at an employee’s residence on a regular basis requires an approved Vehicle Home Storage Request/Permit form, STD. 377, be on file with the employee’s department. Annual renewal of STD. 377 is required. See DPA Section 599.808 and OFAM State Fleet Handbook.\n\nVHSP REQUIREMENTS\n\nState vehicles shall be used only in the conduct of state business, and that no state officer or employee shall use, or permit the use of, any state-owned motor vehicle other than in the conduct of state business (see Government Code Sections 19993.1-19993.8 ). State agencies utilizing non-exempt license plates on state vehicles must strictly adhere to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) rules pursuant to Vehicle Code Sections 5001-5002.6 , and DMV Form INV 218, Request for Nonexempt License Plates. State vehicles stored at or in the vicinity of an employee’s home more than 72 nights in a 12-month period, or 36 nights in a 3-month period, require a VHSP approved by the department head, deputy, or chief administrative officer pursuant to CCR Section 599.808 and STD 377, Vehicle Home Storage Request/Permit Form. Employers must apply facts and circumstances on a case-by-case basis to ensure they follow Internal Revenue Service and Franchise Tax Board regulations regarding taxable compensation for personal use of a state vehicle. The State Controller's Office Payroll Procedures Manual , Section N 129 et seq. has information that covers the taxable event triggered by state vehicle use, as well as the reportable/taxable amount to report and exceptions to the taxable reporting requirements (see State Administrative Manual Section 8572.4). State employees must report the taxable amount monthly on the State Controller's Office STD 676V , Non-USPS Adjustment Request-Values (Fringe Benefits/Employee Business Expense), and submit it to their department’s human resources office. If you have questions regarding the taxable amount or the STD 676V, please contact your department’s human resources office.\n\nCRITERIA FOR ESSENTIAL & COST-EFFECTIVE PERMITS\n\nExecutive Order (EO) B-2-11 specifies that state agencies and departments may only issue VHSPs that are essential or cost effective. In continuance of this policy, DGS developed ongoing criteria to assist departments in their future determinations of essential and cost-effective VHSPs.\n\nESSENTIAL PERMITS\n\nAn essential VHSP is deemed necessary even though it may not be cost-effective; it must meet all of the following criteria:\n\nThe individual must respond to emergency events after hours as a primary responder. The emergency responder must respond to the field, rather than to a state facility where his/her vehicle could be stored. The emergency responder must be able reach the emergency event within 30 minutes to no more than 1 hour. The emergency response must require specialized equipment that is not transferrable to a personal vehicle, or include activity that is not reasonable for a personal vehicle (i.e., taking a felon into custody). The emergency response must be for health and safety purposes (i.e., responding to hazards or criminal activity). The individual only takes a vehicle home when he/she is needed as a primary responder. The individual must respond to a minimum of 24 emergency responses per year. *\n\nA department should not issue an essential VHSP to any employee who does not meet all of the above criteria. It is also incumbent upon the department to report/record information as necessary to support the issuance of an essential VHSP.\n\n*DGS will allow an exemption process for essential VHSPs that cannot meet the minimum of 24 emergency responses per year if a department can demonstrate that there will be a significant health and safety risk to the public if this permit is not issued. A department is required to submit the STD 377, Vehicle Home Storage Request/Permit Form, to DGS for approval and to provide narrative to substantiate the critical need for each VHSP.\n\nCOST-EFFECTIVE PERMITS\n\nA cost-effective VHSP must meet at least one of the criteria from both Category A and Category B:\n\nCategory A\n\n1. The employee has a department-approved home office separate from the department’s facilities. Generally, the employee’s duty statement and personnel file will denote that his/her reporting office is his/her home.\n\n2. The vehicle is essentially the employee’s office (i.e. performing requisite duties in the field on a daily basis directly from his/her home). However, the employee may still be required to occasionally work from a state office.\n\nCategory B\n\n1. The employee’s job (as reflected on the official duty statement) requires substantial field work (greater than 50 percent), and it is more efficient for the employee to travel directly to the field work location.\n\n2. The employee drives directly to the field from home and/or has work-related after-hour activities that account for 50 percent or more work days within a given month.\n\nA department should not issue a cost-effective VHSP to any employee who does not meet the above criteria. It is also incumbent upon the department to report/record information as necessary to support the issuance of a cost-effective VHSP.\n\nThese general standards for cost effectiveness justify the use of a state vehicle versus reimbursement for the use of a personal vehicle or rental – it is not a justification for the state to pay for personal commute miles associated with taking a vehicle home. Providing for personal commuter transportation is not an obligation of the state.\n\nANNUAL CERTIFICATION\n\nBeginning on January 2, 2014, and each year thereafter, state agencies shall submit a DGS OFAM 162 - VHSP Certification Form to DGS that denotes the number of VHSPs issued at that time. DGS may, at any time, request copies of the permits or a list of names and other specific data for the individuals who have been issued permits.\n\nAUDIT REQUIREMENTS\n\nDGS reserves the right to audit state agencies to ensure compliance with the VHSP requirements. DGS further reserves the right to withdraw a department’s ability to issue and approve its own VHSP pursuant to CCR Section 599.808 (d), if it is determined that a state agency is not in compliance with the VHSP policy.\n\nThe following required documents shall be on file and available upon request.\n\n• DGS STD 273, Monthly Vehicle Travel Log shall be completed on a daily basis to record, among other things, the following: daily miles traveled, date and time of travel, itinerary, overnight storage information, and the driver’s name. VHSP annual certifications shall be completed each calendar year.\n\n• VHSP requests (STD 377, Vehicle Home Storage Request/Permit Form) shall be completed for each applicable employee.\n\n• VHSP annual certifications shall be completed each calendar year.\n\n• VHSP requests (STD 377, Vehicle Home Storage Request/Permit Form) shall be completed for each applicable employee.\n\nThe minimum retention schedule for the required documents noted above shall be the current fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year.\n\nShould a state agency conduct its own internal audit of its assigned VHSPs, it is required to provide the VHSP audit results and/or findings to the DGS Office of Fleet and Asset Management."

See Government Code Section 14615 and Public Contract Code Section 10308 . In addition, Government Code Section 13332.09 provides that:\n\n\"No purchase order or other form of documentation for acquisition or replacement of motor vehicles shall be issued against any appropriation until the Department of General Services has investigated and established the necessity therefor. No surplus mobile equipment may be acquired from any source by any State agency for program support until the Department of General Services has investigated and established the need therefor.\"\n\nThe Department of General Service, Office of Fleet and Asset Management ( OFAM ) are eliminating the use of the Vehicle Acquisition Request Form (OFA 160); state departments will no longer submit individual fleet acquisition request to OFAM. This policy applies to all emergency and non-emergency vehicles and mobile equipment, henceforth referred to as fleet assets. Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012-13, state departments are required to submit an electronic Fleet Acquisition Plan (FAP) to OFAM each fiscal year for all new and/or all existing asset replacement needs that have not been previously approved by OFAM. The plan should include any long-term rentals or leases of fleet assets. The FAP contains the documents listed below which must all be included to be considered a complete (FAP). An electronic copy of the FAP documents below can be found at the DGS website located at FAP Documents :\n\nFleet Acquisition Plan Narrative Fleet Acquisition Plan Spreadsheet Fleet Acquisition Certification Other Supporting Documents, as applicable Fire Truck Questionnaire (Addendum A), as applicable\n\nFleet Acquisition Plan Narrative OFAM has created a written narrative format that must be followed. It outlines vital areas that are necessary in order to ensure that the planned acquisitions comply with existing policy and other requirements. Fleet Acquisition Plan Spreadsheet\n\nThe Excel spreadsheet created by OFAM includes the line item detail of each planned new or replacement asset including justification for the need to add or replace an asset. Fleet replacement requests will be analyzed by applying utilization metrics to vehicle utilization data retrieved from the Fleet Asset Management System. Fleet Acquisition Certification This certification is required by Public Contract Code Section 10295.2(a) and Executive Order (EO) B-2-11 . The certification must be signed by the department Director or the Chief Deputy Director. If there is no Director or Chief Deputy Director within the state entity, the signature shall be by the highest level of the executive staff within the applicable state entity. Designees are not acceptable. If the state entity reports to an Agency, the certification must also be signed by the Agency Secretary or authorized designee. The certification shall include the date, title, and signature of the person(s) authorizing the acquisition. The Director of DGS must approve all such purchases, subject to review by the Secretary of Government Operations Agency. Other Supporting Documents Departments should include with their request other documentation if it helps justify the acquisition. For example, if additional fleet assets are being requested that increase the size of the department’s fleet baseline, supporting documentation must be provided to substantiate the request for additional fleet assets. Such documentation may include, but is not limited to, a copy of an authorized budget change proposal, a Governor’s budget line item, or other documentation supporting an increase in staffing or workload corresponding with the need for additional fleet assets. Fire Truck Questionnaire (as applicable) This questionnaire requests additional supporting information and is required for the purchase of fire engines. Due Dates: Electronic copies of the FAP and all required applicable documents must be submitted to OFAM, via email to the department’s assigned FAMS analyst, on or after the first day of the fiscal year (July 1) for which the FAP is being submitted and no later than:\n\nFirst business day of February for one-time-buy acquisitions ( Purchase Estimate Form STD. 66 and STD. 66A ); First business day of April for master vehicle contract acquisitions, donations, and long-term rental/lease acquisitions.\n\nAddendums to FAPs due to extraordinary circumstances (see Addendum to Fleet Acquisition Plan section below) will be accepted if the addendum is submitted to\n\nOFAM\n\nat least 45 working days prior to the end of a fiscal year and the applicable manufacturer’s cut-off dates. Please note : All purchase estimates must be approved (stamped) by OFAM and submitted to DGS Procurement Division prior to April 1st . It is highly recommended that departments that intend to purchase assets with a Purchase Estimate Form (\n\nSTD. 66\n\nand\n\nSTD. 66A\n\n) submit a FAP early in the fiscal year (prior to the February 1st deadline) to help ensure that DGS Procurement Division will be able to process requests in the same fiscal year.

The vehicle is lost/stolen. The department has a demonstrated immediate business need to replace the vehicle with another vehicle that was already approved on a FAP.\n\nNOTE: Model year 2012 or older assets that did not go through the Vehicle Allocation Methodology analysis per the Executive Order (EO) B-2-11 will not be approved as substitution assets.\n\nSubstitution of Approved Purchase\n\nState agencies may request to substitute an approved purchase in the event of the following:\n\nThe approved make/model is no longer available on the statewide vehicle contract. The approved make/model is no longer available to order in the current model year. The approved asset no longer meets the department’s business needs due to changes in the program’s requirements for which the approved asset would be used.\n\nSubstitution Approval Process\n\nTo obtain approval from OFAM, state agencies must submit a complete Fleet Asset Substitution form (OFAM 5) to FAMSSupport@dgs.ca.gov or their designated FAMS analyst. For substitution of replacement, all required attachments (STD. 152, OFAM 6, and police report, if applicable) must be submitted in addition to OFAM 5.\n\nA Substitution request must meet acceptable justification criteria and complies with EO B-16-12 and ZEV/Hybrid First Purchase Mandates.\n\nAny substitution request that includes substantive changes must be signed by the requesting department’s Deputy Director and approved by the Chief of OFAM.\n\nAny substitution request that includes non-substantive changes must be signed by the requesting department’s fleet manager and approved by OFAM’s Fleet Asset Management System (FAMS) manager.\n\nSubstantive Changes\n\nThe following changes are deemed substantive:\n\nSubstituting a ZEV for a lower priority ZEV or a non-ZEV. Substituting a vehicle with a higher-class asset type (asset class upgrade). Substituting a non-Public Safety Special Performance (PSSP) asset to a PSSP asset. Any substitution that changes compliance status with the state’s fleet purchasing policies.\n\nNon-Substantive Changes\n\nSubstitutions that do not result in a downgrade in the ZEV Priority level and/or an upgrade in the asset class are deemed non-substantive. The following are non-substantive changes:\n\nSubstituting a non-ZEV for a ZEV of the same asset class. Substituting a ZEV asset for a higher priority ZEV of the same asset class (ZEV Priority upgrade). 1) and 2) will require a confirmation from the DGS Office of Sustainability that the requesting department has the necessary charging infrastructure to support the request.

As EO B-16-12 presently directs each state agency to ensure that at least 10% of its annual LD fleet purchases be a ZEV, a state agency will now be required to increase its annual LD ZEV purchasing as follows: Fiscal Year EO B-16-12 ZEV Purchasing Requirements (CURRENT) EO B-16-12 ZEV Purchasing Requirements (NEW) 2014/2015 10% 10% 2015/2016 10% 10% 2016/2017 10% 10% 2017/2018 10% 15% 2018/2019 10% 20% 2019/2020 25% 25% 2020/2021 25% 30% 2021/2022 25% 35% 2022/2023 25% 40% 2023/2024 25% 45% 2024/2025 25% 50% ZEVs include pure zero emission vehicles such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEV). Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are considered transitional ZEVs and may be partially considered toward the ZEV requirement. Additionally, medium duty (MD) and heavy duty (HD) ZEV and PHEV purchases may also be considered for the fulfillment of the LD ZEV requirement. However, consideration towards the LD ZEV requirement will be based on their certified electric driving range established by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). See SAM Section 4121.3 “ZEV Credits and Credit Ratios”, for credit information and ranges. To meet the expanded ZEV purchasing targets, beginning in FY 2017/2018 state agencies are required to purchase ZEVs (including Battery Electric, Fuel Cell, and Plug- In Hybrid) and Hybrid-Electric Alternative Fuel Vehicles (Hybrid AFVs), in designated light-duty vehicle categories, in lieu of light-duty vehicles that are powered solely by internal combustion engines utilizing fossil fuels and flex-fuel vehicles or bi-fuel vehicles powered by petroleum based fuels. See SAM Section 4121.1, “ZEV & Hybrid First Purchasing Mandate” for more details.\n\nWhen submitting a FAP, agencies must demonstrate they have sufficient ZEV charging/fueling infrastructure to support their current and future ZEV purchases. See SAM Section 4121.6, “ZEV Infrastructure Readiness” for information necessary to sufficiently demonstrate proper ZEV charging/fueling infrastructure. At least half (50 percent) of the vehicles required to comply with the ZEV purchasing mandate must be pure ZEVs, unless an agency meets the exemption criteria listed in SAM Section 4121.2 “50 Percent Pure ZEV Purchasing Exemption”. LD vehicles having special performance requirements necessary for the protection of public safety and welfare are exempted from these mandates. See the SAM Section 4121.4 “EO B-16-12 Public Safety Special Performance Exemption” for details. All FAPs that do not meet these new purchasing requirements will not be processed."

        "content": "Legal Authority\n\nPublic Resources Code section 25722.5 Executive Order B-2-11\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:\n\nFleet Asset: State vehicles and mobile equipment owned and operated by state agencies. Specific definitions for asset types can be found in SAM 4125 .\n\nIn-service Date: In-service date is the date the agency begins using the asset.\n\nInstalled: A telematics device is physically installed in a vehicle.\n\nOperational: A telematics device is turned on and transmits data to the telematics services software operating platform.\n\nTelematics Application Programming Interface (API): APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For this policy, the telematics API means the communication between the agencies’ telematics database and the DGS fleet asset management system.\n\nTelematics Services: Telematics Services consist of both hardware and software solutions that gather and store geographic and onboard diagnostic information, such as current odometer, maintenance needs, and fuel consumption from vehicles and mobile equipment and transmit that information to a centralized software platform.\n\nTelematics Services Software Operating Platform: A telematics services software operating platform is a data management application provided by the state’s contracted telematics service provider.\n\nPolicy\n\nState agencies (Agencies) must establish telematics policies and have telematics services installed and made operational on state-owned fleet assets (assets). These policies should ensure that agencies utilize telematics to promote employee safety and reduce fleet operational costs. The policies shall, at minimum, address the following areas:\n\nDepartment- and program-level oversight roles and responsibilities. Driver responsibilities. Safe vehicle operation, to include: a. Excessive speeding. b. Seat belt usage. Excessive Idling Reduction.\n\nTelematics services must be purchased using the state’s mandatory telematics service contract and operational for the asset's lifecycle unless exempted by the Department of General Services (DGS), Office of Fleet and Asset Management (OFAM).\n\nAgencies must enroll in the telematics API and upload the Telematics Certification Report in the Fleet Asset Management System (FAMS) Portal to meet the state’s fleet reporting requirements. The API collects the asset’s utilization and fuel consumption data and reports the following data points in the FAMS Portal:\n\nNumber of Days Used Odometer or Hour Meter Readings Fuel Consumption (liquid fuel and electricity)\n\nAdditionally, agencies are required to program the telematics services’ software operating platform to produce electric miles driven reports for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in their fleets which shall be made available to OFAM biannually (on January 1st and July 1st) or upon request. OFAM will provide these reports to the California Department of Finance on an annual basis or upon request.\n\nAll new assets must be installed with a telematics device within 30 days of the in-service date and reported to the FAMS Portal.\n\nTelematics Installation Exemption Criteria\n\nAssets that meet one of the following criteria may be eligible for an exemption based on OFAM’s evaluation. Exemption requests must be submitted to OFAM at FleetPolicy@dgs.ca.gov .\n\nA. Standard Exemption\n\nThe asset is non-self-propelled or not required to be reported into the FAMS Portal. The asset is not capable of having telematics installed or is unable to maintain telematics in an operational status, as determined by OFAM. The asset is categorized as a motorcycle. The asset does not require usage reporting to OFAM.\n\nB. Undercover Vehicle Exemption\n\nAssets that have non-exempt license plates and are used for undercover purposes may be eligible for exemption if the collection and transmission of data associated with this asset’s use may endanger the safety of the asset’s operator or the integrity of the undercover operation. Agencies requesting an undercover vehicle exemption must submit a per-asset-based detailed narrative justification with supporting data substantiating how exactly the collection and transmission of data may endanger the safety of the asset’s operator or the integrity of the undercover operations.\n\nC. Surplus Vehicle Exemption\n\nAssets with an approved STD 152 Property Survey Report may be exempted from the telematics installation requirement. Agencies requesting a surplus vehicle exemption shall provide OFAM with a list of all assets that meet this criterion and their STD 152 approval date. All assets on the list shall exit the agency’s fleet or have had telematics services installed within 12 months from the STD 152 approval date.\n\nD. Cost-Effectiveness Exemption\n\nUnder very limited circumstances, a state agency may receive an exemption from the telematics requirement where the agency can show that the installation and use of telematics services on the vehicle would not provide any meaningful value to the department. Agencies must submit a comprehensive written justification, which must be accompanied by an analysis using quantifiable data, that clearly demonstrates that telematics services would not add value to the department. The analysis conducted must, at minimum, take into consideration the following criteria:\n\nPotential Costs Savings of Telematics Services:\n\nHard Costs: a. Fuel Reduction b. Vehicle Maintenance Cost Reductions c. SMOG Check Automation Vehicle d. Replacement Avoidance e. Stolen Vehicle Recovery f. Vehicle Misuse Avoidance Soft Costs: a. Data Gathering Efficiencies (staff time) b. Operational Efficiencies c.

        "content": "Public Safety agencies are required to utilize services and contracts provided by the OPSCS to obtain all forms of public safety communications, including voice, video, radio, and data services. Use of Consolidated Services Communications is an essential element to the successful delivery of public safety services within state government. The state’s public safety communications infrastructure should be leveraged to streamline processes, enhance interagency and intergovernmental coordination, and rapidly deliver quality services to the people of California. Enabling communications technology is expensive and requires highly skilled, trained staff to manage and operate. The ability to spread the costs for the purchase, operation, and maintenance of this technology over a large base of users allows the state to develop, provide, and expand services at the lowest overall costs to the state. Economies of scale allow the state to: Leverage its purchasing power as a single entity. Maximize the use of its infrastructure. Reduce redundant and duplicative networks. Reduce staff requirements by centralizing highly skilled resources for all public safety agencies to access. Considering the above philosophy, OPSCS develops, implements, and manages a variety of statewide telecommunications services that are designed to accommodate multiple state agency users. Public Safety agencies shall consider utilizing consolidated services whenever and wherever available. Refer to the PSCSG for information on consolidated services, availability, rates, and ordering procedures.\n\nRadio Installation, Modifications, and Maintenance\n\nany installation, modification, or maintenance, including the programming of radio frequencies of radio and microwave transmitting equipment licensed to the state, must be done by, or with the technical approval of, DGS.\n\nRadio Transmitter Licensing\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) must license all radio transmitting devices before being put into service.

The CALNET Program provides state and local government entities Business Telecommunications Systems and Services as defined in GC section 11532. In addition, the CALNET Program provides a communications network that is currently managed through the CALNET Contracts.\n\nThe CALNET Network Infrastructure are Wide Area Networks (WANs) that distribute end-to-end voice, data, and video services through contracted services. They are privately owned, operated, and maintained by CALNET Contractors under OTech’s oversight. The CALNET services are comprehensive and designed to meet the majority of the State’s Business Telecommunications Systems and Services requirements. Individual customers directly purchase services through the CALNET Contracts.\n\nThe CALNET Contracts are easy to use by both state and local government entities because they are already competitively bid , thereby saving entities from conducting their own solicitations.\n\nState Vision\n\nThe state envisions a consolidated, flexible, responsive, secure, survivable, efficient, and cost-effective telecommunications infrastructure that provides seamless end-to-end interoperability for voice, data, and video services, whether separately or as part of a converged service. Owning and operating WANs are not the primary responsibility of the state; therefore, the state’s Business Telecommunications Systems and Services will continue to be procured from private contractor(s) under the oversight of OTech. Where feasible, multiple contractors provide increased diversity and competition that lead to lower prices, more customer choices, and the capability to obtain and rapidly deploy new technologies.\n\nExcept as set forth in SAM chapter 4602, all Executive Branch Entities are required to utilize the CALNET Contracts. In addition, all other state and local government entities are highly encouraged to utilize the CALNET Contracts because it provides ease of procurement, economic benefits, and interoperability for voice and data services.\n\nThe State Telecommunications Management Manual (STMM) provides detailed policy, instructions, and procedures regarding the use and implementation of Business Telecommunications Systems and Services and can be accessed on the CALNET Program website ."

        "title": "STATE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES",
        "content": "The California Department of Technology ( Department of Technology ) has broad responsibility and authority to guide the application of information technology (IT) in California State Government. The Department of Technology’s areas of responsibility include policy making, interagency coordination, IT budget and procurement review, technical assistance, and advocacy. In view of the scope of these activities and their potential impact on state government, the Department of Technology has articulated the fundamental principles, policies, and procedures to govern the use of IT in Sections 4800 through 5180 of the State Administrative Manual ( SAM ). Note that any and all project approvals or conditions made by the Department of Technology’s predecessor organizations, the California Technology Agency (CTA) prior to July 1, 2013, the Office of the State Chief Information Officer (OCIO) prior to January 1, 2011, or the Department of Finance ( Finance ) prior to January 1, 2008; remain in effect unless otherwise notified. Priority of Information Technology. Information technology (IT) is an indispensable tool of modern government. Accordingly, each Agency/state entity is expected to seek opportunities to use this technology to increase the quality of the services it provides and reduce the overall cost of government. Authority and Responsibility. Each Agency/state entity director should be knowledgeable about the information requirements and information management practices of the Agency/state entity and should provide active leadership in the exploration of new opportunities to use IT. Each Agency/state entity should establish clear lines of authority and responsibility for information management. Management of Information. Each Agency/state entity shall establish and maintain an information management function consistent with its own operational needs and organizational structure. This function shall serve to ensure the Agency/state entity’s ability to identify the information it collects, maintain the integrity and security of the information, and provide for appropriate access to the information. Management Methods. Each Agency/state entity shall employ proven management methodologies to guide and control the planning, acquisition, development, operation, maintenance, and evaluation of information management applications. Pilot projects and/or independent oversight shall be required for larger, more complex applications. Basis for Decisions. Decisions regarding the application of IT shall be based on analysis of overall costs and benefits to the people of California over the life of the application. Each Agency/state entity shall plan far enough into the future to ensure that adequate time is available for analysis of alternatives, for obtaining necessary management approvals, and for the administration of procurements. Agencies/state entities shall determine the impact of their decisions across Agency/state entity lines and give priority to alternatives that provide the greatest benefit from a statewide perspective. Record of Decisions. Each Agency/state entity shall maintain records of management decisions concerning the use of IT. These records must be sufficiently detailed to satisfy the requirements of oversight agencies as well as internal management. The records must address such topics as: Identification of IT needs; Setting of priorities for applications of IT; Evaluation of application alternatives; Project management and control; Contingency planning and risk management; and, Operational controls and maintenance provisions. Agency/State Entity Personnel. Agency/state entity managerial, technical and user personnel should possess the knowledge and skills necessary to use IT to the best advantage for the state. Each Agency/state entity should regularly assess the IT skills and knowledge of its personnel in relation to job requirements, identify and document training needs, and provide suitable training within the limits of available resources. Compatibility. In selecting or developing applications of IT, each Agency/state entity shall consider the benefits and costs of maintaining compatibility with other planned and existing applications within the Agency/state entity and in other Agencies/state entities. Such consideration of compatibility shall include computer languages, applications and system software, computer hardware and telecommunications equipment, data formats, and the specific knowledge and skills required of state personnel. Procurement. In acquiring equipment, software, and services involving IT, Agencies/state entities shall seek maximum economic advantage to the state. Procurements shall normally be competitive, in conformance with the applicable sections of the Public Contract Code and SAM. Agencies/state entities shall use master contracts whenever the functional requirements for which the contract was awarded are substantially the same as the Agency/state entity’s requirements.\n\nCost Allocation.\n\nEach Agency/state entity shall adopt policies and establish procedures for assignment of costs associated with IT by program or operational unit within the Agency/state entity, as well as for the assignment and recovery of the costs of services provided to other Agencies/state entities, private individuals, and organizations.\n\nRisk Management.\n\nEach Agency/state entity shall adopt and maintain a risk management program for the purpose of identifying and avoiding or minimizing threats to the security of information it maintains and the operational integrity of its information systems, telecommunications systems, and data bases\n\nDocumentation.\n\nApplications of IT shall be fully documented with respect to the needs of (1) non- technical users; (2) technical personnel; (3) Agency/state entity measurement; and (4) outside auditors. The adequacy of documentation shall be an evaluation criterion in all procurements involving IT (equipment, software, services and telecommunications facilities). Project plans shall include specific provision for the creation of suitable documentation.\n\nProvision for Emergencies.\n\nIn planning for the use of automated information systems and telecommunications facilities, Agencies/state entities shall develop policies and procedures to be followed in times of emergency; when systems are preempted to preserve the public health, welfare or safety; and when other events occur which prevent reliance on automated systems for extended periods of time.\n\nIndividual Rights.\n\nInformation management policies and procedures shall be consistent with the California Constitution, the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, and other applicable laws. Each Agency/state entity shall safeguard the right to privacy of individuals who are the subjects of the records it maintains.\n\nEthics.\n\nIn the conduct of their operations and in the accomplishment of the policies stated above, Agencies/state entities and their employees shall employ IT in a legal and ethical manner consistent with government statues, rules and regulations. IT shall not be used for purposes that are unrelated to the Agency/state entity’s mission or that violate state or federal law.

In some cases, the definitions have been modified to meet state needs.\n\nAccessibility/Accessible : Individuals with disabilities are able to acquire the same information, engage in the same activities, perform the same functions, and access the same content and services as individuals without disabilities, with similar ease.\n\nAgency: This term refers to one of the state's umbrella Agencies. Umbrella Agencies include the Natural Resources Agency, California Environmental Protection Agency, Government Operations Agency, Business Consumer Services and Housing Agency, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, California State Transportation Agency, Labor Agency and the California Health and Human Services Agency.\n\nAgency-affiliated State Entities: This term refers to State entities that are governed by one of the state's umbrella Agencies. See definition of Agency.\n\nAgency Information Management Strategy: An Agency’s/state entity’s information management strategy is the Agency’s/state entity’s comprehensive plan for using IT to address its business needs, e.g., to successfully carry out its programmatic mission. Ideally, the Agency’s/state entity’s information management strategy represents one aspect of a well-defined, overall Agency/state entity business strategy and is therefore closely aligned to its business strategy. If the Agency/state entity has not established a business strategy, Agency/state entity staff that are responsible for the Agency/state entity information management strategy must make assumptions based on their knowledge of the Agency’s/state entity’s overall mission, its program resources and priorities, and the changing nature of its environment.\n\nAlgorithm: A clearly specified mathematical process for computation; a set of rules that, if followed, will give a prescribed result.\n\nAncillary Solicitation: An acquisition that may be necessary to achieve and/or support the primary procurement activities and objectives of an IT project.

Such a strategy typically addresses the Agency’s/state entity’s statutory mission and historical role, the expectations of its key stakeholders (individuals and organizations that affect the Agency/state entity or that the Agency/state entity affects), the factors that are critical to its success as an organization, the Agency’s/state entity’s internal strengths and weaknesses, and the political, social, economic, and technological forces in its environment that support or constrain its programs. Business strategies articulate the key issues that must be successfully addressed by the Agency/state entity and identify the priorities and required resources for proposed actions. A strategy may have a timeframe that is as short as a few months. However, most Agency/state entity business strategies present a three- to five-year perspective, with some Agencies/state entities finding it useful to extend their strategic vision as much as ten to 20 years into the future. Strategic planning is not a one-time effort; it is a fundamental, continuing management process that allows the Agency/state entity to respond in an effective manner to a changing environment.\n\nCalifornia Project Management Framework: The California Project Management Framework (CA-PMF) is a collection of project management best practices and scalable resources, tools, and templates to be used by project management practitioners to effectively plan and manage projects.

The four stages, which document the business analysis, alternatives analysis, solution development and project readiness analysis, must be approved by the Department of Technology prior to the encumbrance or expenditure of funds, including the use of staff resources, on any IT project beyond the Project Approval Lifecycle.\n\nProject End Date: The proposed project end date should reflect the conclusion of project activities: The last date that proposed project activities are estimated to be completed. This should exclude any activities related to the Post Implementation Evaluation Report (PIER).\n\nProject Oversight: An independent review and analysis to determine if the project is on track to be completed within the estimated schedule and cost and will provide the functionality required by the sponsoring business entity. Project oversight identifies and quantifies any issues and risks affecting these project components.\n\nProject Planning Start Date: The project planning start date is the date an Agency/state entity begins a Stage 2 Alternatives Analysis. The planning phase of an IT project proposal begins with the Stage 2 Alternatives Analysis and ends at the conclusion of Stage 4 Project Readiness and Approval (Gate 4).\n\nProject Planning End Date: The project planning end date should reflect the conclusion of project planning activities: The last date that project planning activities are estimated to be completed at the conclusion of Stage 4 Project Readiness and Approval (Gate 4).\n\nProject Start Date: The project start date is the date an IT project proposal is approved and funded. For most projects dependent on a funding request, this date will be July 1st of the year the project funding is approved. For projects without this dependency, the project start date is the project approval date (Gate 4 approval).\n\nProprietary Software: Computer programs that are the legal property of one party, the use of which is made available to a second or more parties, usually under contract or licensing agreement.\n\nPublic Cloud: The public cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public.

The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user- specific application configuration settings.\n\nStaff Augmentation Procurement: The acquisition of contracted services to address state staff resource constraints or skill gaps for IT project activities.\n\nStaff Redirection: The redirection of existing Agency/state entity staff resources to support IT project activities or backfill behind existing staff redirected to support IT project activities. Contracted services are not considered Staff Redirection.\n\nStage/Gate Deliverables: The formal deliverable documents that support the Project Approval Lifecycle. Stage/Gate deliverables are the Stage 1 – Business Analysis, Stage 2 – Alternatives Analysis, Stage 3 – Solution Development and Stage 4 – Project Readiness and Approval. Formal project approval occurs upon approval of the Stage 4 Project Readiness and Approval.\n\nState Entity: Includes every state office, officer, department, division, bureau, board, and commission, including Constitutional Officers. “State entity” does not include the University of California, California State University, the State Compensation Insurance Fund, the Legislature, or the Legislative Data Center in the Legislative Counsel Bureau.\n\nStatewide Information Management Manual (SIMM) : The Statewide Information Management Manual ( SIMM ) as structured by the Department of Technology that contains standards, procedures, instructions and guidelines, as well as samples, models, forms and communication documents that Agencies/state entities must use, or will find helpful to use, in complying with established state policy relating to IT. For clarity, references in SIMM to \"Department of Finance\" that are not related to budget documents, such as Budget Change Proposals or Finance Letters, should be read as references to the \"California Department of Technology.\"\n\nState Telecommunications Management Manual ( STMM ): The State Telecommunications Management Manual (STMM), as structured by the Department of Technology, contains state telecommunications policies and procedures based on SAM 4500-4555 and Government Code Section 11534-11543 . The STMM is continually updated to reflect current telecommunications policies and practices, and links to helpful outside resources are included throughout the STMM.\n\nSystem Standby: A low-power mode for electronic devices such as computers, televisions, and remote-controlled devices (aka “sleep mode”). These modes save significant electrical consumption compared to leaving a device fully on and idle but allow the user to avoid having to reset programming codes or wait for a machine to reboot.\n\nTechnology Letter: Letters issued by the Department of Technology conveying official communications regarding state IT, announcing new or changes to existing IT policies and procedures, or announcing new or changes to existing state IT services or standards.\n\nTechnology Modernization: Actions an organization takes to move away from an outdated and/or unsupported technology or process, to adopt, adapt, or upgrade its technology to current industry best practices and/or standards to allow stable, scalable, and resilient support of the business needs.\n\nTechnology Remediation: The act of correcting an error, or mitigating a threat, vulnerability or identified gap, or responding to unexpected events, or preventing negative outcomes after an assessment of existing technology and/or the business process.\n\nTechnology Stabilization: Actions an organization takes to sustain and/or improve the reliability and availability of its current technology to efficiently support its current business needs.\n\nTelecommunications: Includes voice and data communications, the transmission or reception of signals, writing, sounds, or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, light beam, or any other electromagnetic means.\n\nTenant Managed Services: Centralized Tier III-equivalent data center space providing participating state Agencies/state entities the ability to operate their own environment with a degree of independence in the overall management of their server infrastructure. Additionally, Agencies/state entities can plan utilization of the Tenant Managed Services (TMS) as a disaster recovery site.\n\nTier III-Equivalent Data Center: Data Center facility consisting of multiple active power and cooling distribution paths; however, only one path is active. The facility has redundant components and is concurrently maintainable providing 99.982% availability.\n\nTotal Planning Cost: The total planning cost is the sum of all costs associated with the planning activities conducted in Stage 2 Alternatives Analysis through Stage 4 Project Readiness and Approval.\n\nTotal Project Cost: The total project cost is the sum of ALL costs associated with the project planning phases (Stage 2 through Stage 4) and the project execution phase (design, development, and implementation), plus one full year of maintenance and operations costs.\n\nValidation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610]\n\nVerification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE-STD-610]\n\nVirtualization: A framework or methodology of dividing the resources of a computer into multiple execution environments, by applying one or more concepts or technologies such as hardware and software partitioning, time-sharing, partial or complete machine simulation, emulation, quality of service, and many others.\n\nWorkgroup Collaboration Platform : Cloud-based collaboration tool that integrates features such as chat, conferencing, calendaring, notes, and attachments organized by topics and accessible through a specific URL or invitation. Within the platform, members can create channels or topics of conversation and collaborate through a shared workspace.\n\nWorkload Increase: Employing substantially the same resources (equipment, facilities, IT personnel, supplies, software) to process a greater volume of the same or similar information. The results of the processing are the same or similar outputs distributed to comparable users.\n\nZero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a security trust model that assumes that no entity should be inherently trusted, whether internal or external. It requires strict verification and authentication for users, devices, and applications seeking access to resources. The core principles of ZTA include least privilege access, micro-segmentation, network segmentation, continuous monitoring and analytics, and security automation and orchestration. By implementing these principles, ZTA aims to enhance security, minimize the impact of breaches, and protect sensitive data by consistently verifying and validating entities before granting access."

        "title": "PROJECT APPROVAL AUTHORITY",
        "content": "Authority for approval of information technology (IT) projects lies with the Department of Technology, but it is the intention of the State’s Chief Information Officer to delegate approval authority to Agency/state entity directors to the maximum extent practicable.\n\nWhen an Agency’s/state entity's proposed expenditures on IT are consistent with established policies and when the Agency/state entity has consistently adhered to those policies and successfully implemented IT projects, the Department of Technology will consider delegating authority for the approval of resources to Agency/state entity directors, as defined below.\n\nThe Department of Technology will establish an Agency/state entity-specific cost delegation level, i.e., the project cost level above which the Agency/state entity must obtain project approval from the Department of Technology (see SAM Section 4819.37) before the Agency/state entity is authorized to initiate the project.\n\nThe Department of Technology’s delegations fall into one of four general groups:\n\nGroup 1 – Desktop and Mobile Computing Delegations : Agencies/state entities that have established and currently maintain an acceptable Technology Recovery Plan and plan for the appropriate application of desktop and mobile computing will be delegated authority for the acquisition of equipment and software to support their desktop and mobile computing activities. See SAM Section 4989.2.\n\nGroup 2 – Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Software and Cloud Software-as-a- Service (SaaS) Delegations : Agencies/state entities are delegated the authority for the approval and acquisition of COTS software and Cloud SaaS solutions which are classified as Delegated (see SAM Section 4819.37 for a list of Project Delegation Criteria). The acquisition must meet “ALL” of the following conditions:\n\nSoftware licenses and consulting services will be acquired through a leveraged purchasing agreement managed by the Department of General Services (e.g. CMAS or MSA) or through one of the Department of Technology’s Data Center Service Offerings. Does not require installation of new hardware on premises at the Agency/state entity or its designated data center. Solution is single purpose use, not mission critical, and used for internal purposes only. Does not exchange confidential or sensitive data with other systems.\n\nPursuant to the Cloud Computing policy ( SAM Section 4983), Agencies/state entities must utilize Cloud SaaS services provided by the CDT whenever feasible. Additionally, COTS software services provided by CDT must be utilized whenever feasible. Agency/state entities must notify the Department of Technology of all COTS and SaaS acquisitions prior to project initiation as defined in Statewide Information Management Manual (SIMM) Section 22.\n\nGroup 3 – Agency/state entity Delegated Projects: Approval authority for projects which are delegated to the Agency/state entity director. Agencies/state entities undertaking delegated projects are expected to employ appropriate project review, approval, and reporting procedures as specified in SAM Sections 4819.35 and 4819.36. See SAM Sections 4819.37 and 4819.39 for a list of project reporting criteria and a definition of project cost delegation.\n\nGroup 4 – Requested Delegation for Non-Delegated Projects: An Agency/state entity with an acceptable Technology Recovery Plan and an Agency Information Management Strategy that has been approved by the Department of Technology may submit a Project Delegation Request (see SAM Section 4819.38) to the Department of Technology for new projects prior to the encumbrance or expenditure of funds, including the use of staff resources, on the project beyond the Stage 1 Business Analysis. The Department of Technology will review the form and notify the Agency/state entity whether it has been delegated project approval authority for the proposed project. If delegation is not granted, the Agency/state entity must submit a Stage 2 Alternatives Analysis to the Department of Technology for approval.\n\nAmong the factors considered by the Department of Technology in determining whether to grant delegated project approval authority: The apparent adequacy of the Agency’s/state entity's planning process; The cost, scope, and complexity of the IT project; The size and composition of project staff; The Agency/state entity executive staff's project management experience; The level of complexity and completeness of prior Project Approval Lifecycle documentation prepared by the Agency/state entity; The number and complexity of previous IT projects attempted by the Agency/state entity; The demonstrated ability of Agency/state entity project management staff to successfully monitor, control, and report progress during a complex undertaking; and The Agency’s/state entity's past success in applying IT to attain goals on time and within budget and to realize expected objectives. Delegation of project approval authority will NOT normally be given for projects which: Have significant statewide, interdepartmental, or intergovernmental impact; Involve the establishment or use of nonstandard or extensive communication facilities; Propose software or equipment acquisition expenditures that are large in relation to the Agency’s/state entity's IT budget; Have the potential for involving new or unfamiliar technology; Produce revenue for the State, such as licensing fees, tax collection, etc.; Have a high potential risk associated with the security and confidentiality of the information being processed; Involve IT acquisitions that exceed the Agency’s/state entity’s Department of General Services Delegated Purchasing Authority (as defined in SAM Section 4819.2) or Depend upon decisions to be made during the development or enactment of the Governor's Budget, such as approval of a Budget Change Proposal or Budget Revision. Splitting a project into smaller projects to avoid either fiscal or procedural controls is prohibited. Agencies/state entities undertaking delegated projects are expected to employ appropriate project review, approval, and reporting procedures as specified in SAM Sections 4819.35 (Project Approval Lifecycle) and 4819.36 (Project Reporting/Oversight) below. All IT projects are subject to audit. Documentation supporting project decisions must be kept by the Agency/state entity for a minimum of two years following approval of the Post-Implementation Evaluation Report (PIER). See SAM Sections 4947-4947.2. The Department of Technology, at its discretion, may rescind previously delegated approval authority for individual projects or for all IT activities in progress or proposed by an Agency/state entity. The Department of Technology may require that project planning, design, or implementation be halted or redirected.\n\nThe decision to rescind delegation will typically be based on review (audit) of the Agency’s/state entity's information management practices: review of a specific project; redefinition of the project; significant increases in project cost projections; major cost overruns; specific control language placed on expenditures through legislation (i.e., the Budget Act); identification of significant unresolved technical issues; or a change in the direction of state policy."

Agencies/state entities are required to follow the SIMM Section 19 instructions for preparing and submitting the PAL Stage/Gate deliverables. If, during project development or implementation, the Agency/state entity finds that program requirements cannot be adequately satisfied by the course of action described in the approved Stage 4 Project Readiness and Approval and that an alternative course of action is more appropriate, a Special Project Report (SPR) (SAM Sections 4945-4945.2 and SIMM Section 30 ) shall be prepared. No encumbrance or expenditure of funds, including the use of staff resources, shall be made to implement such change or alternative course of action until approval has been received from the Department of Technology, or from the Agency/state entity director if the Department of Technology has delegated approval of the project to the director and the project remains within the limitations of the Agency/state entity’s delegated authority. SPRs that must be submitted to the Department of Technology must be transmitted within 30 days after recognition of the situation that necessitates preparation of the SPR. Agencies are required to follow the SIMM Section 30 instructions for preparing and submitting the SPR. In the event an SPR approved by the Department of Technology results in a procurement that exceeds the Department of General Services Delegated Purchasing Authority, the procurement will be subject to the Department of Technology/Statewide Technology Procurement Division (STPD) approval. Projects subject to approval by the Department of Technology (non-delegated projects) require submission of PAL Stage/Gate deliverables (beginning at the Stage 2 Alternatives Analysis through the Stage 4 Project Readiness and Approval) to the Office of the Legislative Analyst. See SIMM Section 19 . The Department of Technology will review the procurement planning information in the Stage 2 Alternatives Analysis, as applicable, to evaluate the proposed IT procurement strategy. Projects whose approval has been delegated to the Agency/state entity’s director normally require all PAL Stage/Gate deliverables to be prepared in accordance with SAM Section 4928 and approved by the Agency/state entity director (SAM Sections 4921 and 4927 ). A copy of the analysis, and a signed document indicating approval by the Agency/state entity director, must be on file in the Agency/state entity. The Department of Technology may decide to review specifications in procurement documents before they are advertised to ensure that the specifications are consistent with the solution requirements and proposed architecture in the PAL Stage/Gate deliverables or SPR for the projects.

        "content": "Pursuant to Government Code Section 11545(a) , authority for the approval of Information Technology (IT) Projects resides with the California Department of Technology (CDT), but it is the intention of the State’s Chief Information Officer to delegate approval authority to Agencies/state entities to the maximum extent practicable. IT Projects must be approved or delegated before an Agency/state entity can encumber or expend funds on, or dedicate staff resources to, the IT Project. The following categories identify the criteria for project delegation:\n\nDelegated IT Projects : Pursuant to Government Code Section 11546(b) , the CDT will delegate approval authority for IT Projects to Agencies/state entities based on an assessment of the Agency’s/state entity’s project management, project oversight, and project performance. If an Agency/state entity is assessed to be capable in those respects and the IT project does not meet one or more of the criteria identified in paragraph (B), the IT project will be delegated to the Agency/state entity and the Agency/state entity will have approval authority pursuant to SAM Section 4819.34. Those projects are referred to as “Delegated IT Projects.” Non-Delegated IT Projects : Notwithstanding paragraph (A), IT Projects are considered Non-Delegated if one or more of the following criteria applies: Initiation of the IT Project depends upon decisions to be made during the development or enactment of the Governor's Budget, such as approval of a Budget Change Proposal or Budget Revision to increase the Agency’s/state entity’s existing IT activities related to the IT Project; The IT Project involves a new system development or acquisition that is specifically required by legislative mandate or is subject to special legislative review, as specified in budget control language or other legislation; The IT Project has an anticipated cost that exceeds the Agency’s/state entity’s project cost delegation assigned by the CDT and does not meet the criteria of a desktop and mobile computing commodity expenditure (see SAM Section 4989 – 4989.3); CDT and/or the Agency’s/state entity’s Agency Information Officer (AIO) has determined that the IT project has criticality/risk factors that warrant continued approval and oversight authority by CDT.\n\nIT Projects that meet one or more of these criteria are referred to as “Non-Delegated IT Projects.” However, at any time throughout the Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL), CDT may further delegate “Non-Delegated IT Projects” back to an Agency/state entity based on the risk assessment and evaluation of PAL.\n\nNon-Delegated IT Projects may be delegated back to an Agency/state entity upon the approval of a Project Approval Lifecycle - Project Delegation Request ( PAL-PDR ) (see SAM Section 4819.38), with the subsequent approval of PAL Stage/Gate deliverables by the Agency/state entity Director. An Agency/state entity must have a Technology Recovery Plan and an Agency Information Management Strategy that has been approved by the Department of Technology in order to submit a PAL-PDR."

        "content": "Purpose:\n\nThe California Department of Technology (CDT) recognizes that training and employee development is primarily a responsibility of management. The purpose of the policy is to ensure the effective training and development of Information Technology (IT) employees within the state. The policy works in congruence with Government Code (GC) section 11545(b)(5) and seeks to improve organizational maturity and capacity in the effective management of the IT workforce at the state entity level by defining the roles and responsibilities of the training coordinator. This policy also aims to ensure that employees possess the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their IT-related responsibilities efficiently and securely. The following policy has been created to facilitate these best practices and key objectives.\n\nPolicy:\n\nThe identification of needs, establishment of priorities, and implementation of training reside at the discretion of each state entity. Each State entity should appoint a training coordinator to assist line management in taking inventory of employee skills, training needs, and professional development and coordinate training efforts with other state entities. The training coordinator shall ensure that the state entity’s IT training shall meet the objectives below.\n\nTraining Needs Assessment:\n\nIdentification of learning and development needs is necessary to ensure each employee is equipped with the right skills and knowledge to perform the job efficiently and to their highest ability. Creating a thorough assessment of the IT employee training needs will be conducted within each state entity. The assessment will consider the current skill levels, job responsibilities, and any emerging technologies relevant to the organization.\n\nAnnual Training Plans:\n\nThe training plan should be linked to California's Statewide Strategic Plan and the state entities’ goals and objectives. The annual training plan must include the type of training, training objective, training delivery, budget, sources of training, and training priority.\n\nTypes of Training:\n\nThe type of training should be identified as part of the training plan development. Examples include:\n\nInstructor-led training eLearning Technical training Mandatory training Professional development Simulation employee training Hands-on training Coaching or mentoring Lectures Group discussion and activities Role-playing Management-specific activities Case studies or other required reading\n\nTraining Objectives:\n\nThe training objectives and goals include specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound statements that define what employees are expected to achieve by the end of a training program.\n\nTraining Delivery:\n\nThe training delivery method and process is used to provide instructional content, knowledge, or skills to employees during a training program. It encompasses the strategies and techniques employed to transfer information effectively from instructors to participants. Examples include:\n\nClassroom training Online or e-learning Workshops or seminars On-the-job training Self-paced learning On-demand learning Peer learning\n\nSource of Training:\n\nBoth formal and informal training contribute to learning and professional development. State entities must work closely with CDT to identify those skill areas where they anticipate the need to contract for technical training with outside vendors . Technical training examples include:\n\nExternal outsourced state training External vendor training contract Internal State entity training\n\nAs such, state entities should assess their training needs and utilize IT training offered by CDT before considering similar training from other sources. This includes contacting CDT and leveraging their equivalent IT training, including leadership academies and specialized bootcamps, before procuring training from outside vendors.\n\nTraining Budget:\n\nEstablishing a training budget is essential for state entities to effectively plan, implement, and manage training initiatives. It ensures employees remain up to date and current on IT technologies and processes, improves return on investment, resource allocation, compliance, and certifications.\n\nTraining Priorities:\n\nIt is recommended that priority be given to the development of those skills necessary in the effective performance of each person's current position. After essential needs are met, career-related training needs may be addressed. We also stress the importance of certification and formal education offerings, which could include paying for certification examinations. This helps with retention, morale and is a proven incentive for staff to remain with a state entity. It’s important to remember that IT exists to meet the needs of business and priorities need to be based on that concept.\n\nTraining Records:\n\nThe organization will maintain accurate records of employee IT training completion. These records will include the date of training, type of training, and the names of employees who have completed the training.\n\nEvaluation and Feedback:\n\nTraining will routinely be evaluated to determine if the training is effective and how it can be improved. Feedback will be evaluated and provided to those offering the training for refinement and improvement.\n\nTraining Effectiveness:\n\nThe state entity will periodically assess the effectiveness of IT training programs to ensure they meet the intended objectives.\n\nExemptions:\n\nIf an organization that is planning to utilize IT training services that are similar to CDT training offerings and determines that the use of a CDT provided training solution is not feasible, they shall submit a Service Request for a Training Exemption for CDT approval before proceeding with the acquisition.\n\nExemption Process:\n\nSubmit a Training Exemption Service Request . Identify and explain the need for the exemption. Obtain the State entity’s CIO and/or AIO approval of the Training Exemption Request. Work with CDT to consider alternative solutions. Maintain a central file of granted CDT Training Policy Exemptions and their related acquisition documents. This file must be made available to CDT upon request for audit purposes. Comply with the Training Exemption Response and all related policies, standards, and guidelines.\n\nExceptions:\n\nThis policy does not apply to on-the-job training, state entity in-house training when a vendor is not used, specialized computer-based training modules obtained as part of a hardware or software contract, cooperative training programs developed with other state entities when a vendor is not used, and/or eLearning online subscription-based training.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nPlease refer to our FAQ page for more information."

        "title": "DEFINITIONS",
        "content": "Agency Information Management Strategy . An agency's information management strategy is the agency's comprehensive plan for using information technology to address its business needs, i.e., to successfully carry out its programmatic mission. Ideally, the agency's information management strategy represents one aspect of a well- defined overall agency business strategy and is therefore closely aligned to its business strategy. If the agency has not established a business strategy, agency staff who are responsible for the agency information management strategy must make assumptions based on their knowledge of the agency's overall mission, its program resources and priorities, and the changing nature of its environment. Business Strategy . An agency's business strategy is its overall plan for accomplishing its mission in a changing environment with the resources it can reasonably expect to be available. Such a strategy typically addresses the agency's statutory mission and historical role, the expectations of its key stakeholders (individuals and organizations that affect the agency or that the agency affects), the factors that are critical to its success as an organization, the agency's internal strengths and weaknesses, and the political, social, economic, and technological forces in its environment that support or constrain its programs. Business strategies articulate the key issues that must be successfully addressed by the agency and identify the priorities and required resources for proposed actions. A strategy may have a time frame that is as short as a few months, if there is a limited window of opportunity for significant change. However, most agency business strategies present a three- to five-year perspective, with some agencies finding it useful to extend their strategic vision as much as ten to twenty years into the future. Strategic planning is not a one-time effort; it is a fundamental, continuing management process that allows the agency to respond in an effective manner to a changing environment. Information Technology Infrastructure . An agency's information technology infrastructure is the base or foundation for the delivery of information to support the agency's programs and management. The infrastructure contains elements upon which an agency's information technology activities are dependent. An agency must therefore define, implement, and manage these infrastructure elements to successfully employ information technology. The desirable characteristics of this infrastructure are efficient support for the exchange of information within the agency and between the agency and other organizations; reliable availability of information processing capabilities whenever and wherever they are needed; preservation of the integrity and confidentiality of information maintained by the agency; sufficient flexibility to allow the timely and efficient addition of new information management capabilities and modifications of established capabilities; and consistency with a coherent set of technical and managerial standards for the employment of information technology. Typical elements in an information technology infrastructure include: Application Systems . The applications that an agency purchases and/or develops to achieve personal productivity and program support benefits. Architecture . The guidelines or blueprints that an agency follows in designing, acquiring, and implementing information technology solutions. Organizationally approved definitions, specifications, and standards are the primary components in an agency's information technology architecture. Communications . Local area and wide area network components, including linkages with other organizations. Equipment . An agency's hardware platforms and components ranging from individual personal computers to mainframes and associated peripherals. Facilities . The electrical, ventilation, fire suppression, physical security, wiring, and other components required to support an agency's information technology capability, including the physical structure itself. Funding . Current and projected funding for information technology planning, acquisition, development, and operations activities. Partnerships . Relationships with other public and private sector organizations that support and enable the agency's pursuit and use of information technology. People . An agency's technical staff, user community groups, and executive steering and oversight committees that are charged with information technology planning, approval, development, management, operations, and security responsibilities. Plans . Detailed designs or methods for aligning information technology activities with agency business strategies and accomplishing business objectives. Typical agency information technology plans include strategic, risk management, and operational recovery. Policies . The rules, conventions, and protocols adopted by the agency to govern the pursuit and use of information technology.\n\nProcesses and Procedures . The defined steps for planning, approving, acquiring, developing, operating, maintaining, enhancing, and using information technology within the agency.\n\nService Definitions . The types of services provided, accepted service levels, and service delivery time frames established for an agency's information technology support organization.\n\nSoftware . The set of operating system, utility, communications, user interface, and management programs that enable users to operate and control computers and develop application systems.\n\nThe infrastructure includes elements owned by the agency and available under contract or through interagency agreement. For agencies that employ the services of a consolidated data center, for example, the required data center resources are considered part of the agency's infrastructure.\n\nReengineering the Business Process . The search for, and implementation of, radical changes in business processes that result in dramatic efficiencies, reductions in turnaround time, improvements in quality, or improvements in customer service.\n\nStrategic Planning Process for Information Technology . The process of aligning agency plans for, and uses of, information technology with the agency's business strategies."

In general, activities and proposals that are not supported by an AIMS that meets the basic requirements of this section or that are inconsistent with an Agency/state entity’s established strategy will not be approved or supported by the Department of Technology. Any Agency/state entity that does not have an approved AIMS will have all IT project delegation rescinded, including delegation for expenditures under the Desktop and Mobile Computing Policy (SAM Section 4989.)\n\nThe Agency/state entity must submit documentation of its information management strategy to the Department of Technology at the time it completes its initial strategic planning effort and, thereafter, whenever there is a significant change in strategy. SAM Section 4900.3 provides guidelines for the AIMS documentation that must be submitted to the Department of Technology. Additionally, the Agency/state entity must annually certify that the AIMS approved by the Department of Technology represent its current strategy. See SAM Section 4900.5 and SIMM Section 60 .\n\nNote that approval of an Agency/state entity’s AIMS does not imply approval of specific projects, nor does it guarantee funding for the plan or specific projects an Agency/state entity may initiate under the plan. Project funding must be addressed through the budget process, where final determination will be based on statewide as well as Agency/state entity priorities."

Assigning a skilled Project Manager is of critical importance to the success of IT projects. Project Management qualification requirements may be met through formal training, certification in industry stated project management, or previous experience. The following Project Manager qualification requirements are based on the project’s Complexity Rating and assessed by the Department of Technology IT Project Oversight Division through the Project Approval Lifecycle: Low Complexity Projects – The Project Manager should have some training in project management methodology and project management tools. In addition, the Project Manager should have demonstrated leadership, organization, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills. Medium Complexity Projects – In addition to the requirements identified for low complexity projects, the Project Manager should have substantial project management training and experience leading several low complexity project efforts through all phases of the project lifecycle requiring the effective management of people and technology. The Project Manager should have proficiency in leadership, organization, critical thinking, stakeholder management, and Information Technology. Medium complexity projects typically incorporate more than one technology type or functional group, and the Project Manager needs to be able to manage several different functional groups with different needs.\n\nHigh Complexity Projects – The Project Manager should possess advanced project management certifications and should have been directly responsible for all knowledge areas across all process groups for high-profile medium complexity project engagements and be well recognized for their efforts. The project manager must also have knowledge of various approaches to system development/replacement, procurement, contract management, personnel management, supplier management, stakeholder management, operation support, and Organizational Change Management. A project manager at this level must be able to understand the technology being used but not necessarily be an expert in it. Project managers will be spending most of their time working the planning and controlling aspects of the project as well as dealing with the “political” issues. Delegation, time management, and interpersonal skills are keys to success. Large complexity projects are those that are Agency/state entity-wide or extend beyond the Agency/state entity itself. The person must have the unwavering confidence of Agency/state entity management and be considered an acceptable and respected representative for the Agency/state entity.\n\nThe AIO or the Department CIO, as appropriate, is responsible for ensuring that project managers possess the appropriate qualification before their assignment to an IT project. The Department of Technology may require, at any time, the Agency/state entity to provide evidence of the Project Manager’s certification, training or previous project management experience."

The PAL is also the means of linking a specific IT project to the Agency/state entity’s strategic business plans and IT plans, and to ensure that the proposed project makes the best use of the Agency/state entity’s IT infrastructure. The PAL is divided into four stages, separated by gates (business analysis, alternatives analysis, procurement analysis and solution analysis). Each stage consists of a set of prescribed, cross-functional, and parallel activities to develop deliverables used as the inputs for the next stage. The gates provide a series of “go/no go” decision points that request only the necessary and known information needed to make sound decisions for that particular point in time. As additional information is collected and refined through the lifecycle, the cost estimates, schedules, and business objectives will be progressively updated and evaluated to determine if the project is still practical and if the investment should continue to move forward towards project approval. The model also integrates procurement into the project approval lifecycle, providing better estimates regarding a project’s budget and schedule. The purpose of the PAL is to accomplish the following:\n\nBetter business outcomes for the State through successful IT projects. Result in more successful projects and fewer Special Project Reports. Improve efficiencies through effective project planning and analysis to meet State business needs, while also ensuring compliance with State IT policies. Introduce scalability to the project approval process based on business and/or technical complexity. Ensure each decision point requires only the necessary and appropriate level of information needed to make a sound decision, estimate, or product for that particular stage. Determine whether there is a substantiation for a proposed project, i.e., whether the expenditure of public resources on the project is justified based on the following: Responsiveness to a clearly-defined, program-related problem or opportunity; Selection of the best of the possible alternative; Agency/state entity’s technical and program capabilities; and Financial and/or non-financial benefits over the life of the solution that exceed development and operations costs. Project benefits typically include reduced program costs, avoidance of future program cost increases, increased program revenues, or provision of program services that can be provided most effectively through the use of IT. Provide a means for achieving agreement between Agency/state entity’s executive management, program management, and project management regarding: The scope, benefits, schedule, and costs of a proposed project; Management responsibilities over the course of the project; and Opportunities to collaborate with the Department of Technology. Provide executive branch control agencies and the Legislature with sufficient information to assess the merits of the proposed project and determine the nature and extent of project oversight requirements. To the extent feasible, ensure each step and work product in the lifecycle is useful input into subsequent steps. Ensure that a “no” or a “go back and re-think” decision is communicated as early as possible if the level of detail provided is inadequate."

It applies to all Agencies/state entities employees, contractors, and authorized users who access, use, or manage cloud services on behalf of their organization. The policy aims to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of State data and resources in the cloud environment.\n\nScope:\n\nAs part of the Cloud Computing policy, each Agency/state entity shall:\n\nIdentify and define the cloud computing technical and security requirements for all IT modernization, enhancement, and workload migration efforts. Identify a cloud service model, e.g., Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or Platform as a Service (PaaS) whenever a feasible and cost-effective solution is available. The use of cloud services must be consistent with the factors described in SAM 4981.1 Technical Considerations. In addition, the following shall be considered: Data classification (e.g., public, private, internal, confidential, restricted) of information assets Host location (e.g., on-premises, off-premises, hybrid, or multi-cloud) Target architecture Security, monitoring, and recovery Exit strategy Personnel resources Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Procurement Cloud Readiness INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE (IAAS) AND PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (PAAS) Must consider IaaS and PaaS as an alternative solution for new, expansion, or refresh initiatives. If IaaS or PaaS solutions are not available through the California Department of Technology (CDT), CDT will partner with the Department of General Services (DGS) to determine the best procurement method. SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS) Use SaaS solution(s) p rovided through CDT state service offerings (including email*) or through DGS’ Software Licensing Program (SLP), when implementing commercial and/or government SaaS cloud computing solutions. *Per Government Code Section 11546.3, all Agencies/state entities within the executive branch that are under the direct authority of the Governor must consolidate to the state’s shared e-mail solution. If required SaaS solutions are not provided through CDT, Agencies/state entities may acquire other commercial and/or government SaaS solutions through DGS. DATA CLASSIFICATION & INFORMATION ASSETS Conduct categorization and classification of information assets following the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199, as required by the State Administration Manual (SAM) 5305.5 Information Asset Management policy. Based on data classification pursuant to SAM 5305.5 , ensure compliance with relevant security provisions including, but not limited to those in the California Information Practices Act (Civil Code Section 1798 et seq,), Confidentiality of Medical Information Act ( Civil Code Sections 56 through 56.07 ), Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 1075 , Social Security Administration (SSA) Electronic Information Exchange Security Requirements , Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ( PCI DSS ) including the PCI DSS Cloud Computing Guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) Security Rule, Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health ( HITECH ) Act, and Criminal Justice Information Services ( CJIS ) Security Policy. ARCHITECTURE Cloud solution architecture and design documentation must be provided to CDT at the network, system, infrastructure, application, interface, and data layers. Cloud computing architecture illustration examples can be found in the SIMM 141 California Cloud Services Assessment Guide. SECURITY Reference SIMM 140 Cloud Security Guide to verify security controls and continuous security requirements. Ensure compliance with a System Security Plan per the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171. Additionally, a condensed Cloud System Security Plan (CSSP) template is available on CDT's Security Operations Center (SOC) website to aid entities with documenting their system security posture. Ensure compliance with the security provisions of the SAM (Chapters 5100 and 5300 ) and the SIMM (Sections 5300-A, 5305-A, 5310-A and B, 5315-B, 5325-A and B, 5330-A, B, and C, 5340-A, B and C, 5360-B). Ensure that the commercial and/or government cloud service provider’s Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No.18 Service Organization Control (SOC ) 2 Type II report along with the cloud service provider’s plan to correct any negative findings is available to the Agency/state entity. Other equivalent attestation such as FedRAMP and/or StateRAMP may also be used for attestation SIMM (Section 5325). Ensure that all confidential, sensitive or personal information is encrypted in accordance with SAM 5350.1 and SIMM 5305-A, and at the necessary level of encryption for the data classification pursuant to SAM 5305.5 . Ensure cloud service agreements include the state contracting provisions and specific to the type of service being procured, and all written agreements with cloud service providers address SAM 5305.8 provisions for agreements with state and non-state entities. Ensure that the physical location of the data center, where the data is stored, is within the continental United States, and remote access to data from outside the continental United States is prohibited unless approved in advance by the State Chief Information Security Officer, with a risk assessment completed and with risk acceptance with documented mitigation measures approved by the data owner. Maintain an effective incident response and mitigation capability for security and privacy incidents in accordance with SAM 5340 . Report suspected and actual security incidents in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in SIMM 5340-A and other applicable laws and regulations. Ensure Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is in place following the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) CISA ZTA Maturity Model (April 2023) at the “Initial” baseline for Identities, Devices, Network, Applications/Workloads, and Data. ZTA is following the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-207. Any ZTA gaps must be documented, and remediation progress tracked in the entity’s SIMM 5305-C, Risk Register and Plan of Action and Milestones (RRPOAM) quarterly submission. Enrollment in CDT’s Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring services for all IaaS and PaaS cloud services is required unless the entity has an approved CDT SOC exemption. Develop a Business Impact Assessment, Recovery Point Objectives (RPO), and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) documentation for the hosted system and in support of Technology Recovery Plan (TRP) development required by SAM 5325.1. Document the system security controls via the California Compliance and Security Incident Reporting System (Cal-CSIRS) risk assessment module. EXIT STRATEGY Identify an exit strategy for IT solutions that utilizes a commercial and/or government cloud service. The exit strategy must include the Agency’s/state entity’s ability to export data in pre-defined formats and maintain, when needed, a current backup of the data in the Agency/state entity’s designated Tier III- equivalent data center facility. Designated data center facilities must be unrelated to the cloud provider; data center assignments are described in SAM 4982.1 Data Center Consolidation and Determination of Agency-Data Center Assignments. IT PERSONNEL/WORKFORCE Identify internal state personnel who will implement, configure, and maintain the cloud software and/or environments. Determine if staff training is needed. Determine if contract personnel will be needed to augment state staff. Utilize the Government Code (GC) 19130 Personal Services request process if required. TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP (TCO) The total cost of ownership should include, but not limited to infrastructure costs, data transfer costs, licensing costs, operational costs, support costs, downtime costs, data storage costs, data processing costs, security costs, migration costs, training costs, compliance costs, optimization costs, project costs, and oversight costs. PROCUREMENT Utilize existing CDT IaaS and PaaS services provided through the California Department of Technology (CDT) Utilize existing CDT services or partner with CDT/DGS to determine the best procurement method. Use commercially available SaaS services provided through CDT for office productivity tools including the state shared email solution. Agencies/state entities requesting use of other commercially available SaaS solutions must procure through the Department of General Services. Departments must ensure compliance with th e State Contracting Manual w hen procuring additional products and services available in cloud online Marketplaces. When possible, additional products and services should be procured through department procurement offices to ensure purchasing regulations and requirements are met. Negotiated contract pricing is not applicable to Marketplace products and services. DELEGATED AUTHORITY/EXEMPTION Agencies/state entities who consistently demonstrate cloud readiness, may request delegated authority from CDT. If it is determined the use of a CDT managed or approved cloud service offering is not feasible, a cloud computing exemption must be obtained. The Cloud Computing Exemption request is defined in SIMM 18B. CLOUD READINESS Reference SIMM 141 Cloud Computing Readiness Assessment Guide. Consult with CDT Cloud Services.

Desktop and mobile computing configurations must make use of proven, \"off-the-shelf\" hardware and software and must support business productivity and enterprise capabilities such as:\n\nEnterprise Productivity (MS Office) Access to Corporate Servers (File/Print, Active Directory, etc.) Enterprise Class Applications (Geographic Information Systems, Enterprise Resource Planning, etc.) Enterprise Security (VPN, Active Directory Authentication, Multifactor Authentication, etc.)\n\nThe acquisition of new mobile computing devices for existing staff should replace existing desktop computers or mobile computing devices, not be purchased in addition to a desktop computer (for example a new laptop should replace a desktop computer). Additionally, the acquisition of new mobile phones should replace desk phones when practical. Replacement of desktop and mobile computing commodities acquired as part of a previously approved IT project, as defined in SAM Section 4819.2 , may be included in this policy as such commodities are incorporated into and are no longer distinguishable from the Agency/state entity’s IT infrastructure."

        "content": "Effective July 1st, 2019, as part of the Open Data policy, each Agency/state entity shall:\n\nBuild or modernize Information Technology (IT) solutions in a way that maximizes interoperability and information accessibility. Although this policy does not require Agency/state entities to modernize existing IT solutions, it does require data considerations identified in this section be applied when a state entity undertakes a modernization effort that substantially modifies an existing IT solution. Exercise forethought when architecting, building, or substantially modifying an IT system to facilitate data distribution to the public, where appropriate. Use machine-readable and open formats for information as it is collected or created. Where applicable, machine-readable and open formats must be used in conjunction with electronic or paper-based information collection efforts. Prioritize the use of open formats that are non-proprietary, publicly available, and that place no restrictions upon their use. Apply open licenses, such as Creative Commons Zero (CC0), to information as it is collected or created so that if data are made public there are no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, and adapting. Systems must be scalable, flexible, and facilitate extraction of data in multiple formats and for a range of uses as internal and external needs change, including potential uses not accounted for in the original design (e.g. leveraging standards and industry best practices for information sharing, separation of data from the application layer to maximize data reuse opportunities.) Whenever feasible, make data broadly available to the public through the Agency/state entity’s open data site or portal, pursuant to the limited exceptions outlined in SAM Section 5160.2. Describe information using standard metadata as the data is collected or created. Open Data shall include Project Open Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) standards modified for California, see Open Data Handbook for specifications and formats. Agencies/state entities may expand upon metadata and data dictionaries based on standards, specifications, or formats developed within different communities (e.g., financial, health, geospatial, law enforcement). Groups that develop and promulgate these metadata specifications must review them for compliance with DCAT specifications and formats Metadata and data dictionaries shall be in a machine-readable format to provide users the ability to export when needed. Adopt effective governance and data asset portfolio management approaches, including data management and release practices to ensure consistency. Create and maintain an Agency/state entity enterprise data inventory, see Open Data Handbook for inventory specifications and formats. The inventory shall indicate, as appropriate, if the Agency/state entity has determined that the individual datasets may be made publicly available (i.e., release is permitted by law, subject to all privacy, confidentiality, security, Agency/state entity has ownership of data, and other valid requirements) and whether they are currently available to the public. The inventory shall list any datasets that can be made publicly available at the Agency/state entity’s open data site or portal in a format that enables automatic aggregation by Data.ca.gov and other services (known as “harvestable files”), to the extent practicable. See Open Data Handbook for best practices, tools, and schema to implement the public data listing and harvestable files. Public data listing should include, to the extent permitted by law and existing terms and conditions, datasets that were produced as a result of legislative mandates, state grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements (excluding any data submitted primarily for the purpose of contract monitoring and administration), and, where feasible, be accompanied by standard citation information, preferably in the form of a persistent identifier. Assign a Data Coordinator to coordinate and maintain Agency/state entity’s public data. The Data Coordinator’s contact information must be identified in the enterprise data inventory. Prioritize the collection of data sets. Agencies/state entities shall identify and engage stakeholders as part of the intake process. Create a process to engage with customers to solicit help in identifying data sets of value to the public, in prioritizing the release of public datasets and determining the most usable and appropriate formats for release. Agencies/state entities should make public data available in multiple file formats according to their customer needs (e.g. high-volume datasets of interest to developers should be released using bulk downloads as well as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)). Ensure that privacy and confidentiality are fully protected, and that data is properly secured. Leverage an internal data governance process to determine if information collected or created can be made publicly available or is subject to restrictions (e.g. privacy, confidentiality, security, trade secret, contractual). See Open Data Handbook for additional information. If the Agency/state entity determines that information should not be made publicly available on one of these grounds, the Agency/state entity must document this determination through its internal data governance process. Consider security-related restrictions including National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199 “Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems,” which includes guidance and definitions for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Collect or create only that information necessary for the proper performance and evaluation of Agency/state entity functions and which has practical utility. Limit the collection or creation of information which identifies individuals to that which is legally authorized and necessary for the proper performance of Agency/state entity functions. Limit the sharing of information that identifies individuals or contains proprietary information to that which is legally authorized and impose appropriate conditions on use where a continuing obligation to ensure the confidentiality of the information exists. Data sharing agreements must be created to exchange information across Agencies/state entities and with research institutions in compliance with the State’s information security and privacy policy and standards, see SAM Section 5300 and Statewide Information Management Manual (SIMM) Section 5305-A. Ensure that information is protected commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such information. Agencies/state entities shall consider the standard for information classification detailed in SIMM Section 5305-A and other publicly available information when determining whether information should be considered Personally Identifiable Information."

Domain names must explicitly and unambiguously identify the origin of service. Domain names must not be likely to mislead or confuse the general public. Each entity shall have only one ca.gov domain (except for approved legacy domain names). If an entity already has one or more domain names, additional domains will not be granted for that entity. If multiple entities are involved, identify the lead entity and use a subdirectory or sub-domain within the domain that the lead entity already has, instead of requesting a new domain. Collaborations and interagency agreements exist across all state entities, they do not necessitate or entitle a separate domain. Ca.gov must be the primary domain name even if an agency/state entity also operates non-ca.gov domains such as .com, .org, etc., ca.gov. The non-ca.gov domain(s) can redirect to the ca.gov site.

Existing domain names that do not comply with current policies may not be used as precedent for requesting new non-compliant domains. Domain names must not be used for commercial purposes, such as advertising benefiting private individuals or entities. Domain names must not be used for political campaign purposes. Domain names must not be used to distribute or promote materials whose distribution violates applicable law. Domain names must not be used for malicious cyber activity, such as activity that affects the integrity, security, and overall trustworthiness of the ca.gov domain.\n\nIn the case of a domain name conflict, CDT will allocate domain name to the most appropriate party, at CDT and/or California Government Operations Agency’s (GovOps) discretion.

Defining the Program Need For all IT acquisitions, these steps shall be followed: Define the business need that solutions are to address. Determine whether the acquisition is justified. Verify that the goods and/or services to be acquired are IT. Additional issues and requirements for defining the need are discussed in Chapter 1 of SCM Volume 3 . In planning a new IT system procurement the focus should be towards a “solution” approach so that the State may consider and select from a potential array of IT goods and/or services to meet the public policy and business needs of a State program, rather than specifying a particular product design. 2. Assessing Operational Needs In assessing operational needs, these steps shall be followed: Consider fiscal and budgetary issues. Assess the timeframe in which the acquisition must be completed and determine the schedule for delivery and/or implementation. Assess the impact on physical facilities. Consider the risks associated with the procurement and the goods and/or services to be acquired. Consider risk protection strategies that will both protect the State and encourage competition. Determine whether there are available sources of the goods and/or services to be acquired (including existing State sources and contracts), and whether there is competition in the marketplace. Additional issues and requirements for defining the need are discussed in Chapter 1 of SCM Volume 3.\n\n3. Selecting the Acquisition Method: See SCM Volume 3 2.B3.0\n\n4.

These modifications are in addition to the supplemental language that may be added to the Statement of Work modifying certain sections of the IT General Provisions. All such modifications are to be approved by the California Department of Technology Statewide Technology Procurement Division (STPD) and Legal Services Division, before the contract may be considered valid and final.\n\n5. Obtaining Approvals\n\nFor many IT acquisitions, it is necessary to obtain approvals before starting the procurement process. These approvals shall be obtained, as applicable, before releasing solicitation or purchase documents:\n\nVerify the authority to initiate the acquisition and to sign the resulting purchase document. Obtain and/or verify necessary approvals or delegated authority from the following Control Agencies: Department of Finance ( Finance ), California Department of Technology and/or Department of General Services (DGS). If the acquisition involves telecommunications goods and/or services, verify necessary authority or approvals from the Office of Technology Services ( OTech ), Statewide Telecommunications and Network Division ( STND ). If the acquisition is being conducted via the NCB process or requires Control Agency approval, verify there is an approved NCB request and/or Project Approval Lifecycle Stage 3 Solution Development deliverable prior to releasing solicitation or purchase documents. If the acquisition is being conducted using a procurement method, verify there is an approved procurement request and/or Project Approval Lifecycle Stage 3 Solution Development deliverable prior to release of the solicitation.\n\nFurther details on required approvals are contained in SCM Volume 3 and SIMM 19C."

Information security is also the means by which privacy of personal information held by state entities is protected.\n\nThe state's information assets, including its data processing capabilities, information technology infrastructure and data are an essential public resource. For many state entities, program operations would effectively cease in the absence of key computer systems. In some cases, public health and safety would be immediately jeopardized by the failure or disruption of a system. The non-availability of state information systems and resources can also have a detrimental impact on the state economy and the citizens who rely on state programs.

In addition to compliance with the information security and privacy policies, standards, procedures, and filing requirements issued by the CISO, state entities shall ensure compliance with all security and privacy laws, regulations, rules, and standards specific to and governing the administration of their programs. Program administrators shall work with their general counsel, Information Security Officer (ISO), and Privacy Program Officer/Coordinator to identify all security and privacy requirements applicable to their programs and ensure implementation of the requisite controls.\n\nGoverning Provisions: Government Code section 11549.3 provides the CISO with the responsibility and authority to create, issue, and maintain policies, standards, and procedures; direct each state entity to effectively manage risk; advise and consult with each state entity on security issues; and ensure each state entity is in compliance with the requirements specified in the State Administrative Manual (SAM) Chapter 5300.\n\nGovernment Code section 11549.3 also provides the CISO with the responsibility to coordinate the activities of state entity ISOs for purposes of integrating statewide security initiatives and ensuring compliance with information security and privacy policies and standards. The CISO is also provided with the authority to conduct, or require to be conducted, independent security assessments or audits of any entity. The cost of such assessments or audits shall be funded by the state entity being assessed or audited.\n\nMany information security and privacy requirements are program specific; thus, the legal and regulatory requirements may vary from one program to another. For example, the laws governing security and privacy for health care programs differ from the laws governing energy programs. The following overarching laws, which affect the categorization, classification, protection, and dissemination of information, are applicable to most state entities:\n\nArticle 1, Section 1 , of the Constitution of the State of California defines pursuing and obtaining privacy as an inalienable right. The Information Practices Act of 1977 (Civil Code section 1798 , et seq.) places specific requirements on each state entity in the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of information relating to individuals. The California Public Records Act (Government Code sections 7920.000-7931.000 ) provides for the inspection of public records and authorizes specific exemptions for not disclosing certain records or portions of certain records. The State Records Management Act (Government Code sections 14740-14770 ) provides for the application of management methods to the creation, utilization, maintenance, retention, preservation, and disposal of state records, including determination of records essential to the continuation of state government in the event of a major disaster. ( SAM sections 1601 through 1699 contain administrative regulations in support of the Records Management Act.) The Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (Penal Code section 502 ) affords protection to individuals, businesses, and governmental entities from tampering, interference, damage, and unauthorized access to computer data and computer systems.

The following sections summarize the major steps and procedures of California's state budget process."

        "title": "BUDGET DEVELOPMENT",
        "content": "The State Constitution, Article IV, Section 12 , requires the Governor to submit a budget to the Legislature by January 10 each year. The budget must contain itemized statements for recommended expenditures and estimated revenues. California Constitution requires a balanced budget; therefore, if the proposed level of recommended expenditures for the budget year exceeds available resources, the Governor is required to recommend the sources from which the additional revenues should be provided.\n\nThe Director of Finance, as the chief financial advisor to the Governor, directs preparation of the Governor's Budget and its subsequent update in the May Revision. Under the policy direction of the Governor, the Director of Finance issues instructions and guidelines for budget preparation to agencies and departments.\n\nAlthough California does occasionally use budgeting concepts such as Zero-Based Budgeting, Mission-Based Budgeting, Management by Objectives, and Total Quality Management, the primary method utilized to prepare the budget is incremental budgeting for support budgets and zero-based budgeting for capital outlay appropriations. Incremental budgeting uses current department/program levels of funding as a base amount to be adjusted by budget change proposals (BCPs). BCPs have traditionally been the method for departments to propose changes to their existing budgets. Finance issues specific instructions for preparation of BCPs annually in a Budget Letter, and departments submit BCPs to Finance for review and analysis. Capital outlay budgets do not generally have a base amount. The amount of funding is one-time in nature.\n\nA fundamental goal in the budget development process is to resolve budget issues at the lowest level possible. Departments under an Agency Secretary must clear their proposals through their respective Agency before submitting them to Finance. For non- Agency departments, proposals are presented directly to Finance. Issues which are not resolved between departments and Finance staff are discussed with the Finance Program Budget Manager. Issues still not resolved at this level are potentially discussed further at appeals conducted by the Director of Finance. The most sensitive issues are ultimately presented to the Governor for a decision.\n\nAfter all decisions are completed, Finance coordinates with the Office of State Publishing for printing of the various publications related to the Governor's Budget. They are also available on Finance’s public website at http://www.dof.ca.gov:\n\nGovernor's Budget Summary–A summary volume which includes the Governor's goals and objectives for the forthcoming fiscal-year, and the policy perspectives and highlights of the changes in the Governor’s Budget.\n\nGovernor's Budget–A detailed presentation for each department for the past, current, and budget fiscal-years.\n\nSalaries and Wages Supplement–A detailed presentation of authorized staffing and related salaries.\n\nThe Governor annually unveils the budget at a formal press conference. The Governor's State of the State address also typically includes a general presentation of the Administration’s budget policies and priorities.\n\nBy constitutional requirement, the Governor's Budget must be accompanied by a Budget Bill itemizing recommended expenditures not to exceed estimated revenues which shall be introduced in each house of the Legislature. Proposition 58 (2004) amended the Constitution by requiring the Legislature to send a balanced Budget to the Governor for consideration and the Governor to sign a balanced budget. The Constitution also requires that the Legislature pass a Budget Bill by June 15 (or the legislators’ pay will be forfeited during the delay)."

        "title": "BUDGET ENACTMENT",
        "content": "The Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee and the Assembly Budget Committee are the two primary legislative committees that hear the Budget Bill. See SAM 6945 , Legislative Process. They each assign items in the bill to several subcommittees (by major subject areas such as Education or Health and Human Services) which conduct budget hearings. These hearings generally begin in February. The Legislative Analyst is appointed by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and is charged with providing a nonpartisan analysis and recommendations for changes to the Governor's budget plan. The Legislative Analyst publishes a number of reports on its website and in hard copy form that include these analyses and recommendations.\n\nIn addition to the Legislative Analyst, Finance and departments typically provide testimony at the subcommittee hearings. Input is generally provided by partisan fiscal committee consultants of both the majority and minority parties. Additionally, lobbyists and the public may provide testimony at the hearings.\n\nFinance proposes adjustments to the Governor's Budget through \"Finance Letters.\" Pursuant to Government Code section 13308 , Finance is required to give the Legislature all proposed adjustments, other than Capital Outlay and May Revision, to the Governor’s Budget by April 1. Capital Outlay adjustments are due by May 1. The traditional May Revision adjustments are due by May 14, and consist of an update of General Fund revenues and changes in proposed expenditures for school funding requirements pursuant to Proposition 98, caseload, enrollment, or population. The Legislature typically waits for the May Revision update before final budget decisions are made on major programs such as Education, Corrections, and Health and Human Services.\n\nTypically, when the subcommittees complete their actions, they report their recommendations to the full committee of their respective houses. Upon adoption of the budget by the full committee, a recommendation is made to the Floor (full house). Upon simple majority vote of the house, the Budget Bill is passed to the other house. A Budget Conference Committee is generally then appointed to work out differences between the Senate and Assembly versions of the bill. Upon completion of action by the Conference Committee and a simple majority vote, this conference version of the budget is then sent to each house for approval.\n\nSometimes the Conference Committee does not reach final resolution on the budget. This stalemate typically results from non-resolution of a few significant issues. These issues are then resolved by the \"Leadership\" or \"Big 5\" (Governor, Speaker of the Assembly, President Pro Tempore, and the minority leaders of both houses).\n\nWhen the Budget Bill receives a simple majority vote of each house, it is passed on to the Governor. The Constitution allows the Governor to reduce or eliminate an item of appropriation.\n\nThe Constitution requires the Legislature to submit a balanced budget to the Governor for consideration, and the Governor to sign a balanced budget. The Constitution also requires the Legislature to pass a Budget Bill by June 15, or forfeit their pay during any delay.\n\nFinance publishes these two particular documents upon enactment of the Budget Act which are available on Finance’s website:\n\nFinal Budget Summary – An annotated version of the Budget Act which includes amendments to the Budget Act, and the effect of vetoes on the items and sections of the Budget Act. Final Change Book Report – The detail of changes between the January 10 budget proposal and the enacted budget.\n\nOften budget changes proposed by the Governor or the Legislature require changes to existing law in order to implement. To accomplish this, various separate bills (called “trailer bills” because they trail the Budget Bill) are introduced to implement these changes. Pursuant to Government Code section 13308 , all proposed statutory changes necessary to implement the Governor’s Budget are due to the Legislature by February 1."

        "content": "The annual Budget Act is the primary source for appropriations that provide legal authority to expend. The Constitution and other legislation also provide expenditure authority. Departments have the primary responsibility to operate within budgeted levels and to comply with any restrictions or limitations required by law. Further, the general expectation is that state departments comply with the legislative intent. Although the general expectation is to conform to the enacted budget, the Legislature has recognized a need to establish some flexibility to adjust budgets. For example, statute provides a continuous appropriation for allocations by the Director of Finance to meet expenditures resulting from natural disasters for any emergency proclaimed by the Governor. The Legislature has also included provisions in the Budget Act to allow for budget adjustments. Generally, such authority requires Director of Finance’s approval; many require a formal notice to the Legislature and a waiting period to provide the opportunity for legislative review and response before final approval. Budget Act provisions to allow adjustments include authorizations for: Changes to federal funding levels Unanticipated costs (shortage of expenditure authority) Changes to reimbursements Intra-item transfers Finance approves budget changes using Budget Revisions, Executive Orders, and letters. These changes are transmitted to the State Controller’s Office, which maintains the statewide appropriation control accounts for accounting. The Governor has certain powers to adjust expenditures; but these powers do not permit adjustment of appropriations. For example, past Governors have issued executive orders to implement hiring and equipment purchase freezes and to delay capital expenditures. The Governor is also authorized to declare an emergency and may redirect state resources to meet emergency needs, or ask the Legislature to appropriate funds from the Budget Stabilization Account (“rainy day fund”)."

Program A program is a group of closely related and interdependent activities. A program should be clearly delineated, have minimum overlap and interaction with other programs, and lend itself to at least partial quantification. It should be end-product or intermediate- product oriented. Programs should involve specific objectives of the department, bringing together all associated costs displayed in the program budget. Program Budget The program budget is the department’s budgetary presentation designed to display its program activities. A program budget defines objectives and relates the proposed level of expenditures to meet those objectives in the given fiscal year. It is not uncommon to find different ways to subdivide programs and program budgets. In the earlier budget presentations, the hierarchical program structure divided programs into elements, elements into components, and components into tasks. However, as presentations began to expand and proliferate to the lower levels of the program structure, a general policy was adopted to limit departmental presentations in the Governor's Budget to no lower than the sub-program or project level. Program Descriptions All of the department’s pertinent program facts are shown in the program description. The complete program description becomes a tool for departmental program managers. It should be kept up-to-date to reflect executive and legislative action. Some parts of the program description may be used in the annual departmental budget. 3-Year Expenditures and Positions\n\nThe 3-Year Expenditures and Positions display in the Governor’s Budget and enacted budget provides a department’s expenditures and positions by program.

        "content": "The annual financial plan consists of the Governor's Budget, as amended in the May Revision, to the extent approved as part of the final budget, Budget Bill and other bills with fiscal or program impact as enacted, estimated revenues, and spending authority.\n\nThe Governor has complete and final responsibility for \"the Governor's Budget\" and the “initial Budget Bill.” However, preparation of the Governor’s Budget and the initial Budget Bill is actually a product of the entire executive branch. Although the constitutional officers and the segments of higher education have a certain level of autonomy, the Governor typically requests their cooperation in seeking, establishing, and implementing the fiscal policies of the Administration. Decisions, small and large, must be made by many persons. While legislative and administrative leaders make crucial decisions on specific questions raised during the budget process, they are largely dependent on information presented to them. It is essential therefore that everyone involved in the preparation of the budget try to create a meaningful, well developed and fully justified plan, and not expect the budget review process of the Administration to accomplish an impossible task for which it is not designed.\n\nOnce the Governor has submitted the Governor’s Budget and the Budget Bill to the Legislature, the process involves both the Administration and the Legislature. Both houses of the Legislature schedule budget hearings where the Administration defends the Governor’s proposals and the Legislature takes actions on those proposals. At May Revision, the Governor updates revenues and expenditures, and proposes a revised plan to the Legislature. Once both houses have adopted a joint budget after resolving differences through Conference Committee or other meetings, a balanced budget bill is sent to the Governor for consideration, which the Governor may sign, veto partially, or veto the entire bill."

Estimates will be prepared in accordance with instructions issued by the Department of Finance such as Budget Letters. For the past year, the amount of actual contributions may be taken from the appropriate allotment expenditure account.\n\nThe Public Employees' Retirement component includes all state contributions for state employees covered under the Public Employees' Retirement System (Government Code Sections 20000 through 21703 ). The Old Age and Survivors' Insurance data include all state contributions for state employees covered under the Federal System (Government Code Sections 22000 through 22603 ). The State Employees' Health Benefits component includes all state contributions for state employees enrolled under any approved health benefit plan (Government Code Sections 22750 through 22944.5 ). Costs of payments for health and welfare for nonpermanent, prevailing rate employees as authorized by Government Code Section 19830 will be applied as operating expenses. Workers’ Compensation for state officers and employees is budgeted as an item of Staff Benefits. State entities that carry Workers’ Compensation policies with the State Compensation Insurance Fund will not budget additional funds for Workers’ Compensation benefits. They will continue to budget funds for payments of premiums that will be included as a part of Staff Benefits. Because of the nature of this type of expense, some agencies may have to rely upon certain subjective factors in computing requirements. Departments should prepare estimates taking into consideration all pertinent factors, particularly those which might result in a difference in cost from that experienced in past years. Accident and injury experience loss rates, changes in working conditions affecting risk exposure, changes in number of employees and salary rates are examples of areas that can fluctuate yearly. Other Post-Employment Benefits includes all state prefunding contributions for state employees covered under the Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act (Government Code Sections 22750 through 22944.5 ) for postretirement health benefits and the State Employees’ Dental Care Act (Government Code Sections 22950 through 22959 ) for postretirement dental care benefits.\n\nIf a department is proposing additional funding for staff benefits, a BCP must be submitted to Finance. Any BCP must meet the guidelines and policy provided by Finance through Budget Letters or other notification process. If no variation is expected, the following method may be used in computing Workers' Compensation Insurance expense:\n\nDetermine total Workers' Compensation Insurance expenses for departmental employees for each of the past three years. This information is available from the Compensation Insurance Fund. Determine total salaries and wages paid to departmental employees for each of the past three years excluding staff benefits. Divide the total expenses for three years by total salary and wages for three years to determine the ratio of Workers' Compensation Insurance expenses to salaries and wages. Apply this ratio to the total salaries and wages estimated to be required for the budget and current years to determine the amount required."

        "content": "DGS’s Real Estate Leasing and Planning Section uses the Space Action Request (CRUISE Form 9), as part of the Form 10 package when required to obtain Department of Finance (DOF) approval. NOTE: Departments initially request RESD services via Global CRUISE, which is RESD’s online project initiation system. The Global CRUISE system should be used to request services such as: New or additional space (including swing space), lease extensions, or renewals desired by an agency in non-institutional buildings— whether state-owned or state-leased, relocatable buildings, and trailers. If DOF approval is needed prior to proceeding with a new project, the requesting department with the assistance of the Real Estate Officer, prepares the CRUISE Form 9 and supporting documents for the Form10 package based on the data contained in the Global CRUISE summary. DOF’s Review Requirements. A request is submitted to RESD via the Global CRUISE system. DGS forwards a copy of the CRUISE Form 9 as part of the Form 10 package to the DOF Capital Outlay Unit for approval if any one of the following conditions exists: Rental costs (excluding one-time costs) as determined by DGS are estimated to exceed $300,000 in any year of the firm term of a lease. Lease renewals are exempt from this requirement unless: A ten percent or greater increase in space is requested; or The department will propose a budget augmentation to meet rent increases. The department will require a budget augmentation for any year within the firm term of the proposed lease. In this respect, one-time costs, including moving, equipment, furniture, telephones, and data processing related costs, etc. must be considered. The department (or DGS) proposes: A lease with a purchase option pursuant to Government Code Section 14669 (b) ; A lease-purchase (installment purchase) arrangement; note that a lease with a ―bargain‖ purchase option is defined, for the purpose of this section, as a lease-purchase; A lease which in any other fashion meets the definition of a capitalized lease per the Capital Outlay Section in SAM 8363 . A lease which must be noticed to the Legislature pursuant to Government Code Section 13332.10 . The DOF re-reviews any CRUISE Form 9 or which costs significantly exceed the level originally indicated by DGS and concurred with by DOF. Thresholds for re- review are established by memorandum of understanding between DGS and DOF. Whenever a CRUISE Form 9 is submitted to DOF, it must be accompanied with an Estimate of Occupancy Costs form, STD. 10, prepared by DGS and reflecting DGS’ recommended space strategy. The STD. 10 provides a clear synopsis of the reasons for the recommended move or other action; how the action is consistent with approved asset management plans; a schedule of estimated costs for each year of the expected term of the lease and a detailed breakdown of the estimated one-time costs and/or savings associated with the action; and any rent overlaps expected. In addition, an OREDS 4083 Space Planning Data Form must be submitted which provides information on employee classifications for the tenant department, type of space, and specifics on specialized space needs. For certain requests, DGS also prepares a separate economic analysis for DOF verifying that the selected method of procuring space (lease, lease-purchase, lease with purchase option) is the most cost effective, including a comparison with state construction. The conditions of this analysis (i.e., for which projects, and the content) are set by memorandum of understanding between DGS and DOF. The DOF’s review of CRUISE Form 9s consists of two parts: The Capital Outlay analyst reviews DGS’ analysis justifying the method of procuring space and the consistency with approved asset management plans. The appropriate DOF support analyst determines whether the program assumptions for the space request are valid, including any possible future growth requirements. The DOF Capital Outlay unit coordinates this review. The normal time frame for DOF review is less than 30 days. Questions on the status of any space action request which has been forwarded to DOF should be directed to this unit. The DOF’s approval of the CRUISE Form 9 does not constitute approval of additional funding for any future rental increase or other costs related to the CRUISE Form 9 . The department may wish to coordinate the timing of space action requests with the budget process to avoid making commitments to new space prior to budgetary approval. Requests for a budget adjustment must be submitted as part of the normal budget preparation process. Requirements are reviewed below. Coordination of CRUISE Form 9s with Support Budget Change Proposals (BCPs). The BCPs are required for any request to increase support budget funding for new or additional space, rent increases on an existing lease, furniture (such as modular), or costs associated with moving. The BCP must be submitted with a copy of the Form 10 package previously approved by DOF. If a final version of this package is not available because the leasing transaction is still under development, DOF will base its review of the BCP on the department’s initial estimate on draft version of the package. However, the department is still required to complete the Form 10 package approval process by having DGS submit a final set of forms: CRUISE Form 9 and Estimate of Occupancy Cost Form 10 and OREDS 4083, with complete data, for approval to DOF. As appropriate, DOF may adjust any prior budget decisions to conform with the final CRUISE Form 9. It is not necessary to coordinate the BCP process with the CRUISE Form 9 process if the BCP is requesting facility funding as a per - position complement. For example, the department may request five new positions for a program, with a per -position facility component. However, such complements are usually adequate only for marginal adjustments of staff. Therefore, departments are cautioned against using per-position complements if large numbers of staff are being added or specialized space is required. Additional facility funding may not be provided later to correct budget shortfalls. Coordination of CRUISE Form 9 with Capital Outlay Budget Change Proposals (COBCPs). Informational COBCPs are required for proposals to enter in the budget year into a lease-purchase agreement, lease with purchase option, or any other lease which meets the definition of a capital lease, as described in the ‖capitalized Assets‖ Chapter (Capital Outlay Section) of SAM. The opportunity to enter into such a lease may arise, on an unplanned basis, off-cycle with the budget process. The DOF may waive the formal COBCP requirement in this situation, but the client department and DGS must nonetheless provide the same information as well as the economic analysis referred to above as part of Form 10 approval package."

Generally, twice a year, DGS sends a list of claims with no statutory authority for payment to the Department of Finance (Finance). Finance analysts work with the affected departments to identify the appropriation to be charged and to certify that the necessary funds are available. These claims are then included in a claims bill and the chaptered bill reduces individual Budget Act items and transfers the authority for payment of claims to DGS.\n\nWhen statutory authority for payment already exists, legislation is not required and the department may pay DGS approved claims directly without obtaining approval from Finance. The most common reason why a claim may lack statutory authority for payment is because it arose from a stale-dated warrant and the department no longer has expenditure authority for the fiscal year in which the warrant was issued.\n\nGovernment Code section 905.2(f) authorizes DGS to assess a surcharge in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the total approved claim. These surcharges are treated as expenditures to the Budget Act items listed in the legislation.\n\nJudgments and Settlements\n\nIn this situation, a chaptered claims bill authorizes DOJ to pay settlements or judgments directly from specified fund balances because there are insufficient funds available in an individual appropriation. To initiate inclusion of a judgment or settlement in a DOJ claims bill, Finance is required to send a letter to DOJ approving the settlement or judgment claim and certifying that the affected department’s appropriation cannot absorb the cost of claim.\n\nIf the department has sufficient expenditure authority for payment of the claim, legislation is not required and it may pay the claim directly after obtaining approval from Finance.

Section 28.00 (federal and other non-state funds) and Section 28.50 (reimbursements from state departments) require reporting to the Legislature of increases and decreases in the amounts available for expenditure which have not been previously considered and approved by the Legislature.\n\nThe majority of Section 28.00 and Section 28.50 actions are necessitated by a department or agency receiving federal funds and reimbursements which have not been previously considered by the Legislature in the regular budget review process. To minimize the number of Section 28.00 reports, every effort should be made by departments to anticipate federal funds which may be received, and to include in the Governor's Budget or May Revision a description of the project and a cost estimate.\n\nForms DF–90 (Section 28.00) and DF-91 (Section 28.50) are to be used by departments to request adjustments to existing spending authority. The primary responsibility for completing the information on the Section 28.00/28.50 forms rests with the applying department. The completed form may serve as an attachment to a transmittal letter to the Legislature prepared by Finance following a review of the application submitted.\n\nSection 28.00\n\nSection 28.00 authorizes Finance to approve the expenditure of unanticipated funds to be received from federal or local governments, or any other non-state entity. However, for federal funds, Section 28.00 does not allow Finance to increase items of appropriation authorized by the Legislature. Instead, Section 8.50 provides the authority to increase federal fund items of appropriation. Other non-state, unanticipated receipts must be appropriated by other authority, or be received as reimbursements under Section 28.00. Regardless of the source of the additional funding, any augmentation that exceeds either $400,000 or 10 percent of the amount available for expenditure in the affected program, project, or function must be reported to the Legislature and may not be authorized until 30 days after the notification. This reporting requirement does not apply to federal funds related to caseload increases in the Medi-Cal, CalWORKs, and Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment programs.\n\nNo proposed expenditure may be made from any additional funds reported in a Section 28.00 letter to the Legislature prior to the approval and return of the Section 28.00 application by Finance.\n\nAugmentations for items for which the Administration had knowledge to include in its current budget plan should not be submitted through this Section.\n\nTo receive consideration for an augmentation, departments are required to either (1) notify Finance within 45 days of receiving official notice of the availability of additional, unanticipated federal or non-state funds, or (2) explain in writing to Finance why the 45-day notification was infeasible or impractical. In either case, the department must provide Finance a copy of the official notice of fund availability. If a department expends funds without proper approval, it will be required to absorb such expenditures within its existing appropriations or sponsor legislation to authorize the expenditure.\n\nSection 28.50\n\nSection 28.50 authorizes Finance to approve a state department’s expenditure of money received as reimbursement from another state department. Finance approvals that exceed $200,000 must be reported to the Legislature and may not be authorized until 30 days after the notification. However, if the funding for the department providing the reimbursement has previously been approved by the Legislature, these approvals are considered technical in nature and are authorized in Section 1.50 of the Budget Act."

Because of the need to respond to emergency situations immediately, there may be times when it may be difficult to secure advance approval of Finance. For this reason, Finance, under the authority of Government Code section 13078 and EO B–48–78, has given standing authority to the Secretary of the California Emergency Management Agency ( Cal EMA ) formerly the Office of Emergency Services (OES)), or the Director's duly designated representative, to direct any agency to utilize and employ state personnel, equipment, and facilities to prevent or alleviate actual or threatened damage due to an emergency, without prior DOF approval, providing the cost of such urgency actions by all state agencies does not exceed $25,000 for each emergency response as directed by the Secretary of the Cal EMA. For expenditures above this level, Finance approval is required. Government Code section 8649 further provides that any state agency which uses its personnel, property, equipment and appropriation for such declared emergencies, and said agency contains funds which are subject to constitutional restriction prohibiting their use for such purposes, shall be provided reimbursements, and the original expenditure shall be considered a temporary loan to the General Fund. In the event a department is unable to absorb all the costs associated with an emergency response, it should request assistance from Finance. Appropriate Finance staff will direct immediate attention to the anticipated funding deficiency and provide guidance to the department projecting the shortage. The Director of Finance will evaluate and make decisions on each request for supplemental funding on an individual basis. Budget Letter 09-13, issued April 20, 2009, describes this process.\n\nPreparing for an Emergency\n\nBy EO B–48–78, the Governor ordered in part that:\n\nSpecific assignment of emergency functions to a given agency will be made in an Administrative Order by the Secretary, Cal EMA , following consultation with the respective agency head.

A committee may also \"hold\" a measure by making no recommendation to the floor to pass or amend it. Technically, only the house floors can (by majority vote) amend a piece of legislation. However, the recommendations of the committees are nearly always carried out by the floors as a matter of course. There are basically two types of committees: \"policy\" committees and \"fiscal\" committees. The vast majority of measures are sent to a policy committee for review of the proposed programmatic or public policy change. If a measure would have a fiscal impact on the state, then it is also sent to a fiscal committee for review of financial implications of the measure. In the Senate, there are two fiscal committees, Appropriations and Budget and Fiscal Review. The Budget and Fiscal Review Committee deals primarily with the Budget Bill. However, it will also conduct hearings on other pieces of legislation which would directly amend or otherwise significantly affect the Budget Act. The Appropriations Committee hears all non-Budget Bill legislation that would have a fiscal impact. The Assembly has two fiscal committees, Appropriations and Budget, whose functions are the same as their Senate counterparts. Each house also has a Rules Committee which is considered neither a policy nor a fiscal committee since it deals with \"housekeeping\" and other matters internal to that house. It is the Rules Committees that assign bills to the various standing committees. There also are a number of \"joint\" committees comprised of members from both houses. Some examples of these are the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (which oversees the operation of the Legislative Analyst), and the Joint Rules Committee (which develops rules that govern the two houses in addition to the individual houses’ rules). Each house may also establish \"special\" and \"select\" committees. These committees generally are established to conduct research into or provide oversight on narrow areas of subject matter for the purpose of providing special expertise and advice to the house which created them. They generally do not hear bills and meet infrequently. A complete listing of all committees and their memberships can be found in each \"Daily File.\""

        "content": "The Legislature meets in two-year sessions. The sessions roughly coincide with the biennial elections at which all of the Assembly seats and half of the Senate seats are up for election. Each two-year session is considered a ―regular session.‖ The California Constitution ( Article IV, Section 3 ) prescribes that the regular session shall begin on the first Monday in December in each even-number year (i.e., following the election the preceding November) and end November 30 two years hence (i.e., after the next election). The sessions are referred to by the two calendar years which they almost encompass (e.g., the session after the elections in 1996 is the 1997–98 regular session—it begins in December 1996 and ends in November 1998.) Within the constitutionally prescribed dates of convening and adjourning the session, the Legislature has freedom to set its own calendar of meetings and recesses. Generally, however, the Legislature begins meeting in January each year and concludes its work for the year in September. During the year, the Legislature traditionally has scheduled two recesses, an Easter recess of one week and a summer recess of usually four weeks. In addition to the regular session, the Governor may by proclamation require the Legislature to meet in “special session.” A special session may run concurrently with the Legislature’s normally scheduled meeting time and/or during its recesses. During the special session, the Legislature may only act on subjects specified in the proclamation. To handle both the regular session and a special session at the same time, the Legislature may have to temporarily recess its work in the regular session, convene in the special session and then reconvene the regular session after temporarily recessing the special session. This recessing and reconvening may happen more than once on the same day. Other than being limited to the subject matter for which it was called, there is no significant difference in process between a regular and special session. However, the effective dates for bills enacted during a special session are somewhat different than those for a regular session. (See Article IV, Section 8 for more details.)"

There is no \"pocket veto\" in California such as exists at the federal level.

        "content": "When a legislator wants to propose a measure, she/he must go to the Legislative Counsel to have the specific language of the proposal put in proper bill form. The Legislative Counsel's staff, which provides legal services to both houses in support of the legislative process, will draft the language of the code section amendments to accomplish the author's purpose.\n\nThe staff attorney will also write the Legislative Counsel's Digest for the bill, which includes a summary of the current law and what the proposed changes will do. At the end of the Digest, Counsel will indicate the vote required for passage of the bill (usually \"majority\" or \"two-thirds\"), whether the bill must be referred to the fiscal committees, and whether the bill contains a state-mandated local program.\n\nWhen the bill is written, it is returned to the author who will then introduce it in the house of which she/he is a member. From there, the bill proceeds through the legislative process.\n\nThe following presents the steps a bill typically goes through to become law.\n\nBILL FLOW IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE\n\nI. Introduction (first reading)\n\nA. Author puts a legislative measure \"across the desk\" of the floor of the member's house.\n\nB. Measure is given a number (e.g., AB 456, SB 612, ACA 3, SJR 1).\n\nC. Title of measure is read on the floor of the house of origin. (The State Constitution prohibits any bill from being enacted unless it is \"read\" on three separate days in each house, or unless two-thirds of the members of a house vote to dispense with the reading of a bill. Reading aloud the title of a bill at this point constitutes the first of the three readings.)\n\nD. Measure is assigned (\"referred\") to a standing policy committee by the Rules Committee of the house of origin. The committee of assignment is based generally on the subject matter of the bill.\n\nII. Consideration by Policy Committee\n\nA. Committee holds public hearing.\n\n1. Date set by committee and published in advance in the Daily File of the house of origin.\n\n2. Hearing may be scheduled any time beginning 30 days after introduction of the bill unless it is an urgency measure, in which case the 30-day provisions can be waived by a 3/4 vote of the house.\n\n3. On the day of the hearing, the author presents the bill to the committee and explains why the committee should approve it. The policy committee is concerned primarily with the policy or programmatic features of the bill, not its fiscal consequences. Proponents and opponents also present their views on the measure. In addition, the committee may invite experts on the issue under consideration to testify.\n\nB. Committee recommendations to the floor, which generally require a majority vote of the committee, are customarily in one of the following forms:\n\n1. \"Do pass\"–if the committee wants the bill to become law.\n\n2. \"Amend and do pass as amended\"–if the committee rejected the original form of the bill, but approved it with certain specified changes or \"amendments.”\n\n3. \"Amend and re-refer\"–if the committee wants the bill to be considered by a committee again after it is reprinted as amended. \"Amend and re-refer\" may bring the amended bill back to the same committee or it may specify another committee (usually a fiscal committee) that can properly consider the measure.\n\n4. \"Do pass and re-refer\"–if the committee recommends the bill favorably without amendments but sends it to another committee. If the bill has a fiscal impact (\"Fiscal committee: yes\" at end of digest) it will be re-referred to the fiscal committee.\n\n5. \"Do not pass\"–if committee opposes the bill, but prefers to let the house decide.\n\n6. \"To the house without recommendation\"–if the committee is divided or uncertain and wants the house to decide the bill on its merits.\n\n7. \"Refer to Interim\"–if the committee believes the subject is of sufficient importance to need further in-depth study by a legislative committee before adequate legislation can be written, then this recommendation suggests that the bill receive detailed analysis and hearings during the Legislature's recess (interim) period.\n\nC. Instead of reporting its recommendation, the committee may effectively kill the bill by voting to \"lay it on the table\" or by taking no action (i.e., ―holding‖ the bill in committee).\n\nIII. Consideration by Fiscal Committee\n\nEssentially the same procedural requirements apply to the fiscal committees as do to the policy committees. However, these committees' attention, and the testimony they hear, is focused primarily (though not necessarily exclusively) on the fiscal ramifications of legislation, not the program or policy issues involved.\n\nIV. Second Reading in House of Origin 1\n\nA. The measure is listed in second reading file of the floor of the house of origin, but consideration usually involves no more than reading the bill number to satisfy procedural requirements.\n\nB. If the committee recommended amendments, such amendments are printed as part of the bill and may be discussed and adopted.\n\nV. Third Reading in House of Origin\n\nA. The measure listed on third reading file is taken up for final passage when the author is ready to present it.\n\n1. The author of a bill makes the case for approving the bill and floor debate may take place.\n\n2. Members of the House may ask questions of the author and make statements of support or opposition to the measure.\n\n3. Vote on final passage of bill is by roll call.\n\nB. According to the California Constitution, \"Any bill introduced during the first (odd) year of the biennium of the legislative session that has not been passed by the house of origin by January 31 of the second (even) calendar year of the biennium may no longer be acted on by the house. No bill may be passed by either house on or after September 1 of an even numbered year except statutes calling elections, statutes providing for tax levies or appropriations for the usual current expenses of the state, and urgency statutes, and bills passed after being vetoed by the Governor.\"\n\nVI. Procedure After Bill Passes House of Origin 1\n\nA. Sent to other house where same general procedure is followed.\n\nB. If passed in second house, bill is returned to house of origin with a transmittal message stating either:\n\n1. Bill passed second house and may be enrolled and sent to the Governor 2 or\n\n2. Bill passed second house with amendments, and concurrence in amendments by house of origin is requested so that bill may be enrolled and sent to Governor. 2\n\nAn exception to the above is specified in the Constitution: \"Until the budget bill has been enacted, the Legislature shall not send to the Governor for consideration any bill appropriating funds for expenditure during the fiscal year for which the budget bill is to be enacted, except emergency bills recommended by the Governor or appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Legislature.\"\n\nC. If amendments are not satisfactory to house of origin, it appoints members of its house to a Committee on Conference and notifies the other house to appoint its Committee on Conference members (each house appoints three members to a conference committee).\n\n1. Conference Committee considers the bill and seeks agreement on its final form.\n\na. If conferees cannot agree, a new Committee on Conference is appointed.\n\nb. If no agreement is reached on the third conference try, the bill is dead.\n\n2. Conference Committee reports its recommendations to both houses, each of which must adopt the conference report at a roll-call vote (majority or two-thirds, depending upon the nature of the bill) before the bill can be sent to the Governor.\n\nVII. Action by Governor\n\nA. Sign or Veto—Article IV, Section 10 of the California Constitution provides: \"Each bill passed by the Legislature shall be presented to the Governor. It becomes a statute if he signs it. He may veto it by returning it with his objections to the house of origin, which shall enter the objections in the journal and proceed to reconsider it. If each house then passes the bill by roll-call vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership concurring, it becomes a statute.\" This latter action of the Legislature to approve by a two-thirds vote a bill vetoed by the Governor is referred to as a \"veto override.”\n\nB. Item Veto—The California Constitution provides: \"The Governor may reduce or eliminate one or more items of appropriation while approving other portions of a bill.\n\nC. He shall append to the bill a statement of the items reduced or eliminated with the reasons for his action. The Governor shall transmit to the house originating the bill a copy of his statement and reasons. Items reduced or eliminated shall be separately reconsidered and may be passed over the Governor's veto in the same manner as bills.\" Overriding a gubernatorial veto requires a two-thirds vote.\n\nD. Deadlines for Action—The Constitution goes on to specify how much time the Governor has to act on (sign or veto) a bill sent to him/her. If the Governor does not act within that time, the bill becomes law without signature. Generally, the Governor’s deadlines are as follows:\n\n1. In the first year of the session:\n\nIf the bill is delivered to the Governor before the interim recess: 12 days to act.\n\nIf the bill is delivered after the beginning of recess: 30 days to act.\n\n2. In the second year of the session:\n\nIf the bill is delivered before adjournment: 12 days to act.\n\nIf the bill is delivered on or after September 1: until September 30 to act.\n\nThe Governor’s timeframe for action begins when the bill is received. The date a bill passes the Legislature usually is not the day the Governor receives it. After passage by the Legislature, the bill must go to ―enrolling and engrossing‖ where it is prepared for formal transmission to the Governor. Sometimes, several days will elapse between the time of final legislative approval of a bill and the time the Governor receives it.\n\nVIII. Effective Dates of Statutes\n\nA. Under the State Constitution, except for statutes calling elections, statutes providing for tax levies or appropriations for the “usual current expenses of the state,” and urgency statutes, \"...a statute enacted at a regular session shall go into effect on January 1 next following a 90-day period from the date of enactment of the statute and a statute enacted at a special session shall go into effect on the 91st day after adjournment of the special session at which the bill was passed.\"\n\nB. Urgency statutes are those \"...necessary for immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.\" A statement of facts constituting the necessity shall be set forth in one section of the bill (the ―urgency clause‖). Urgency bills become effective upon enactment unless a different effective date is specified in the bill. An urgency statute may not create or abolish any office or change the salary, terms, or duties of any office, or grant any franchise or special privileges, or create any vested right or interest.\n\n1 Simple resolutions (HR and SR) require no further action than acceptance by the house of origin.\n\n2 Neither resolutions nor constitutional amendments require the signature of the Governor. Constitutional amendments, however, must receive a favorable vote at the next statewide election before they become effective."

        "content": "The subject matter of legislation is derived from a variety of sources. In some instances, legislators introduce bills based on their own knowledge of, or personal experience with, the subject matter the bill proposes to affect. More frequently, legislators are asked by individuals or organizations to introduce (or \"author\" or \"carry\") a bill for them. Those making such requests are said to be the ―sponsors‖ of the bill. One large source of sponsorship is the individual departments within state government. A department may feel that if a particular statute is amended, repealed, or enacted, then some aspect of its administrative function will be done more efficiently or the effectiveness of a program will be enhanced. If this is the case, the department will request a member of the Legislature to introduce such legislation. No department under the authority of the Governor may sponsor legislation without the prior approval of the department’s Agency Secretary and the Governor’s Legislative Secretary. All proposals to introduce legislation from departments under the control of the Governor are sent to the Legislative Unit in the Governor's Office after approval at the Agency Secretary level. The Legislative Unit then forwards copies of the proposals to DOF for review and comment. In addition, a department’s proposal may also be forwarded to other departments which may be affected by the proposal for their comment. All legislative proposals must be consistent with the decisions made during budget preparation. Proposed legislation is routed by the Governor’s Office through the DOF for analysis. The fiscal impact of proposed legislation is of particular concern. Fiscal impact includes proposals which would: (1) appropriate money; (2) result—for any reason—in additional expenditure of state money by any state agency or to reimburse any local government for a state mandate; (3) result in any loss or gain of revenue to a state or local government entity; or (4) result in a substantial reduction in expenditures of state money by reducing, transferring, eliminating or making more efficient the administration of any existing responsibilities of any state agency, program or function.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the originating organization to develop valid fiscal information for proposed legislation. This information must include the estimated fiscal impact to both state and local government.\n\nThe proposal must include an estimate of the initial fiscal impact in the first year of implementation and the full-year cost for a succeeding fiscal year. It must also identify the source of funds involved (e.g., General Fund, a particular special fund, a specific federal grant). When funds are available in the department’s budget to cover any costs of a proposal, those resources must be identified to DOF by the proposing department. If the proposal does not involve an appropriation or state fiscal impact, a statement attesting to that fact and noting that funds will not be requested in subsequent budgets is to be included in the department’s proposal."

Methodology for Making Estimates.\n\nIn conducting the SRIA required by Section 11346.3(c) of the code, an agency shall use an economic impact method and approach that has all of the following capabilities: Can estimate the total economic effects of changes due to regulatory policies over a multi-year time period. Can generate California economic variable estimates such as personal income, employment by economic sector, exports and imports, and gross state product, based on inter-industry relationships that are equivalent in structure to the Regional Industry Modeling System published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Can produce (to the extent possible) quantitative estimates of economic variables that address or facilitate the quantitative or qualitative estimation of the following: The creation or elimination of jobs within the state; The creation of new businesses or the elimination of existing businesses within the state; The competitive advantages or disadvantages for businesses currently doing business within the state; The increase or decrease of investment in the state; The incentives for innovation in products, materials, or processes; and The benefits of the regulations, including but not limited to benefits to the health, safety, and welfare of California residents, worker safety, and the state’s environment and quality of life, among any other benefits identified by the agency. The department’s most current publicly available economic and demographic projections, which may be found on the department’s website, shall be used unless the department approves the agency’s written request to use a different projection for a specific proposed major regulation. Such approval shall be made on a case-by-case basis. An agency that anticipates that it will take more than one year to develop a major regulation is encouraged to work with the department in determining the most appropriate projections to use. Costs and benefits shall be separately identified for different groups of agencies, businesses and individuals if the impact of the regulation will differ significantly among identifiable groups. The agency shall compare regulatory alternatives with a baseline that reflects the anticipated behavior of individuals and businesses in the absence of the proposed major regulation and shall identify the baseline it used. In comparing proposed regulatory alternatives with an established baseline, an agency should consider including the following in its analysis: A description of feasible alternatives to the proposed major regulation and the rationale for choosing the proposed major regulation over the other alternatives considered. This description should also include: An explanation of how the need for the proposed major regulation affects the selection of regulatory alternatives; An evaluation of the legal and statutory constraints that limit the selection of regulatory alternatives. Whenever possible, at least two alternatives should be compared to the proposed major regulation, including: An alternative that could achieve additional benefits beyond those associated with the proposed major regulation; and A next-best alternative that would not yield the same level of benefits associated with the proposed major regulation, or is less likely to yield the same level of benefits. A comparison of the cost-effectiveness of different alternatives. Both total and incremental benefits and costs should be estimated. Incremental benefits and costs are the differences between the estimates associated with the alternatives considered. Whenever possible, final rather than intermediate outcomes should be used as measures of effectiveness. In cases where the proposed major regulation addresses more than one measure of effectiveness, weights should be applied to different categories of effects. The uncertainties associated with the estimates should be discussed. If there are significant differences between the incidence or timing of costs and benefits of a regulation, distributional effects should be addressed, including how the effects of the regulation are distributed, for example, by industry, income, race, sex, or geography, and how the effects are distributed over time. The assumptions, analytical methods, and data used in the analysis should be documented. To the extent possible, the analysis should rely on peer-reviewed literature. The source for all original information should be documented. An analysis of estimated changes in behavior by businesses and/or individuals in response to the proposed major regulation shall be conducted and, if feasible, an estimate made of the extent to which costs or benefits are retained within the business and/or by individuals or passed on to others, including customers, employees, suppliers and owners. For each assessment of the value of benefits of the proposed major regulation required by section 11346.3(c)(1)(F) of the code, the agency shall describe the applied analytical methods and data sources used and the results of that analysis. The agency’s assessment may rely on current and (if applicable) projected market transaction data where a market exists that can directly reveal the quantity or monetary value of a projected benefit of the proposed major regulation. The agency may use an indirect approach (e.g., use values derived from related markets) in cases where the value of the benefits can be inferred from actual choices made by individuals in related markets. The assessment should rely on current and (if applicable) projected market transaction data. The agency may use a direct approach (e.g. use values from surveys), estimating the value of the benefits based on hypothetical choices made by individuals responding to a survey. The agency may estimate the value of the benefits based upon an existing study of another regulatory policy with similar subject or physical characteristics. This estimate should describe how the agency took into account the differences in the characteristics (such as time span, specific benefits to value, population, and other socio-economic factors) between the study and the proposed major regulation. In assessing the effects of a regulatory proposal on the General Fund and special funds of the state and affected local government agencies attributable to the proposed major regulation, including the cost of enforcement and compliance to the agency, an agency shall follow the Department of Finance instructions in the State Administrative Manual sections 6601, 6602, and 6604 through 6616.\n\nNOTE: Authority cited: Section 11346.36 , Government Code.

When an agency fails to comply in whole or in part with this chapter, the department shall identify in its comments the area(s) where the agency is out of compliance.\n\nNOTE: Authority cited: Section 11346.36 , Government Code.

        "content": "For the purposes of implementing these guidelines, the following definitions apply:\n\nAgency, Local . Any city, county, special district, authority, or other political subdivision of the state.\n\nAgency, State . Every office, officer, department, division, bureau, board, council, or commission in state government. A ―state agency‖ does not include an agency in the judicial or legislative branches of state government.\n\nDirect Fiscal Costs\n\nPersonnel needed to perform a line function or activity prescribed (expressed or implied) in the regulation. Fringe benefits associated with those personnel, e.g., retirement, OASDI, workers’ compensation. Operating expenses associated with those personnel, e.g., if compliance is achieved by contracting with a private vendor. Any additional equipment which will have to be purchased or leased in order to comply with the regulation. Allocation of other personnel-related costs if not otherwise allocated through an indirect cost system. Some agencies may allocate the costs of rent, space, utilities, etc., directly to the personnel involved.\n\nEconomic Impact. All costs or all benefits, (direct, indirect and induced) of the proposed major regulation on business enterprises and individuals located in or doing business in California. All costs or all benefits, (direct, indirect and induced) of the proposed major regulation on business enterprises and individuals located in or doing business in California.\n\nA direct economic impact is the first-round impact of the policy change from the proposed regulation, e.g., a cost to a business of investing in new required equipment or a benefit to consumers of having additional health coverage. There are two additional types of economic impacts – indirect and induced – which are the reactions to the direct economic impact. An indirect economic impact is the secondary economic impact resulting from the direct economic impact, e.g., the extra sales of equipment to the regulated businesses, or the additional supply or demand for health care from expanded coverage. An induced economic impact is any other economic impact of the policy change from the proposed regulation not accounted for by the direct or indirect economic impacts, e.g., the additional household spending by employees of firms selling extra equipment or in the health care industry, or the additional tax burden on businesses and individuals from fiscal costs associated with enforcing the regulation.\n\nCalculating an economic impact for a major regulation includes all costs or all benefits, computed without regard to any offsetting benefits or costs that might result directly or indirectly, to business enterprises and individuals directly affected by the regulation.\n\nFiscal Costs . All additional expenses for which either supplemental financing or the redirection of existing staff and/or resources (with or without the need for supplemental funding) is required. Costs include those which can be absorbed in an agency's existing budget.\n\nIndirect Fiscal Costs . Any costs related to the additional personnel or operating expenses described in the preceding which are not directly allocated or assigned to those personnel. They do not include a pro rata share of the costs of any manager or supervisor above the first line supervisors since it is assumed that any such supervisors would be in place whether or not the personnel hired to comply with the regulations were there. For example, if a regulation necessitated the hiring of additional staff in a county welfare department, it would not be appropriate to assign, through an indirect cost system, a portion of the costs of the county welfare director to those new personnel since the director would exist to perform his/her functions even if the new personnel were not hired.\n\nMajor Regulation. Any proposed rulemaking action adopting, amending or repealing a regulation subject to review by OAL that will have an economic impact on California business enterprises and individuals in an amount exceeding fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) in any 12-month period between the date the major regulation is estimated to be filed with the Secretary of State through 12 months after the major regulation is estimated to be fully implemented (as estimated by the agency), computed without regard to any offsetting benefits or costs that might result directly or indirectly from that adoption, amendment or repeal.\n\nMandate . A requirement with a consequence of noncompliance of either (1) a criminal penalty, (2) a civil liability, or (3) an administrative penalty.\n\nPublic Agency . Any state agency, city, county, special district, school district, community college district, county superintendent of schools, or federal agency.\n\nReasonable Compliance . No universal definition is available. However, the ―prudent person‖ test can be utilized to arrive at an appropriate definition of the term. For example, if an agency is required by regulation to provide transportation for certain persons, it clearly would not be appropriate to purchase limousine-type luxury automobiles to do so. On the other hand, it would not be appropriate to provide the service by purchasing tandem bicycles. Reasonable compliance can be achieved with some mode of transportation between the two extremes cited. The issuing agency must evaluate each instance separately and determine what ―reasonable compliance‖ would be. The estimate developed must clearly indicate the mode or level of activity it has assumed would achieve such compliance.\n\nSince compliance connotes that the regulation involves a requirement, costs incurred by state or local agencies in exercising any authority granted by a regulation which is permissive or optional are not germane and need not be estimated.\n\nRegulation. Every rule, order, or standard of general application or the amendment, supplement, or revision of any rule, order or standard adopted by any state agency to implement, interpret, or make specific the law enforced or administered by it, or to govern its procedure.\n\nThe term \"emergency\" means a situation that calls for immediate action to avoid serious harm to the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare. An emergency regulation is adopted pursuant to Government Code Section 11346.1 .\n\nRevenues . Any changes in the amounts of operating income received by state and local agencies as the result of an executive regulation must also be identified. In this context, ―revenue‖ includes taxes, state and/or federal assistance, fees, licenses, and so forth.\n\nSavings . Both actual budget reductions and the ―freeing up‖ of staff and/or resources for reassignment to other areas of legitimate concern of the agency.\n\nSchool District . Any school district, community college district, or county superintendent of schools.\n\nSpecial District . Any agency of the state which performs governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries. Special district includes a redevelopment agency, a joint powers agency or entity, a county service area, a maintenance district or area, an improvement district or improvement zone, or any other zone or area. Special district does not include a city, a county, a school district, or a community college district.\n\nCounty free libraries established pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 19100) of Part II of the Education Code, areas receiving county fire protection services pursuant to Government Code Section 25643 , and county road districts established pursuant to Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1550) of Division 2 of the Streets and Highways Code shall be considered special districts for all purposes of this section.\n\nStandardized Regulatory Impact Assessment. An analysis of the economic impacts of proposed major regulations which is required for any proposed regulation that has an estimated economic impact to business enterprises and individuals located in or doing business in California exceeding $50 million in any 12-month period between the date the major regulation is estimated to be filed with the Secretary of State through 12 months after the major regulation is estimated to be fully implemented."

Legislation defining a new crime or changing an existing definition of a crime. Legislative mandates enacted prior to January 1, 1975, or executive orders or regulations initially implementing legislation enacted prior to January 1, 1975. Subdivision (c) of Article XIII B provides that a mandated new program or higher level of service includes a transfer by the Legislature from the state to cities, counties, cities and counties, or special districts of complete or partial financial responsibility for a required program for which the state previously had complete or partial financial responsibility.

If the state agency fails to provide appropriate funding, then affected local agencies are authorized to file claims for reimbursement with the Commission on State Mandates. In order to prepare the local mandate determination required by Government Code Section 11346.5 ; i.e., a determination as to whether the proposed regulation imposes a mandate on local agencies or school districts, it is necessary to first answer the following question: Will the regulation require local entities to undertake a new program or to provide an increased level of service in an existing program? If the answer to this question is \"No,\" then check box 4, 5, or 6 in Section A of STD. 399 . If the answer is \"Yes,\" it is then necessary to determine if the costs resulting from the mandate are not state reimbursable based one or more of the statutory exceptions in subdivisions (a) through (g) of the Government Code Section 17556 as follows: Implements a federal mandate. Implements a court mandate. Implements a mandate in a ballot measure approved by the voters. Results from a documented request from the only local governments affected. Provides (or fall within the purview of existing) revenue sources or other financing mechanisms. Results in savings that are equal to or exceed any costs. Creates, eliminates, or changes the penalty for a new crime or infraction.\n\nIn addition to these statutory exclusions, the courts have held that costs of statutes and regulations are not reimbursable if they:\n\nResult from an action undertaken at the option of a local government (County of Contra Costa vs. State of California, 177 Cal App 3d 62.79 (1986). Are not unique to local government, e.g., affect both the private sector and the public sector (County of Los Angeles vs. State of California et al, 43 Cal App 3d 46 (1987)).\n\nIf it is determined that the regulation does not impose a reimbursable mandate on local government, it is still necessary to include a specific statement reflecting that determination in the notice and to develop estimates of any non-reimbursable local costs. If it is determined that the regulation does impose a reimbursable mandate on local government, then it is important to state the mandate precisely. This is normally best accomplished by employing a statement, expressed in mandatory terms, which identifies both the affected local governments by group and the activity that will be required of them, e.g., \"county clerks shall provide each polling precinct worker with an American flag,\" \"school districts shall provide each student with a lunch box at no cost to the student,\" \"all local governments shall record on videotape all meetings of their governing bodies.\" With the mandate so stated, it is then possible to proceed to develop an estimate of its cost to local government."

        "content": "(Revised and renumbered from 6622 on 3/2009) A standard methodology has been developed for use in estimating costs in regulations. The main components of that methodology are (1) statement of the mandate, (2) background or introductory material, (3) working data, (4) assumptions, (5) calculations, and (6) conclusion. Descriptions of these components are as follows: Statement of the Mandate This is described in SAM Section 6606. Background or Introductory Material This component must include the following: A legal description of the legislation which is the basis for the regulation, e.g., Chapter 1234, Statutes of 1996 (SB 123, Smith). Any other pertinent historical data. Working Data Working data are any available statistical data and their sources which would identify the affected universe. (For example: Secretary of State data on the number of registered voters and/or polling places, State Department of Education data on school enrollees, or State Controller’s reports for the number of local governments.) Also, any \" market place\" information or standard costs of items needed to comply with the mandate, e.g., quoted process for forms, lunch boxes, video cameras (sales, rentals, or contract services). In addition, it is very useful and, in some instances essential, that a representative sampling of the affected local governments be contacted and queried as to the impact of the mandate on them. Very often organizations representing the affected local governments such as the California State Association of Counties (CSAC) and the League of California Cities can either provide such information directly or identify those local governments most likely to be most affected by and/or able to provide information regarding the mandate’s impact on them. Each county has designated a person, usually in the County Executive’s Office, as a \"local mandate coordinator\" for purposes of providing information, upon request, on pending legislation and handling Commission on State Mandates claims. Those coordinators should also be able to assist in developing fiscal estimates for regulations.\n\nAssumptions\n\nOn occasion, data regarding the affected universe and/or the price of the mandated item are not readily obtainable. In these instances, it may be necessary to make some reasonable assumptions about the impact. These assumptions must be clearly stated and kept separate from the ―hard‖ data used in developing the estimate.\n\nCalculations\n\nAny mathematical computations using working data and/or assumptions necessary to arrive at a resultant cost figure must be displayed. Costs for both the balance of the current fiscal year and for the subsequent two fiscal years must be developed.\n\nSeparate calculations must be provided for local, state, and federal costs, as appropriate, as described in the succeeding sections. Any savings to each level of government must be similarly identified.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeterminations made by the issuing state agency regarding the applicability of the California Constitution to any resultant costs and/or the need to provide additional funding of any state costs.

These costs must be identified and estimated by the issuing state agencies even when they are not reimbursable state mandated costs. These costs will generally result from regulations which fall under one of the statutory exceptions listed in Section 6606.\n\nThe basic estimating methodology is the same as that set forth in SAM Section 6607; however, it is important to clearly indicate that these are not constitutionally reimbursable mandates and to develop estimates of offsetting savings and costs. For these regulations no estimate of costs is required since only ―other nondiscretionary costs‖ are specified in law; however, there may be occasions where it would be desirable to have an estimate of the costs that would be incurred if all eligible local governments took advantage of the authority conferred by the regulation."

In fact, it should be relatively simple to derive estimates of savings since affected local governments must be able to identify what they are doing and what the associated costs are. The discretionary savings must also be identified since the state would be providing local governments with the option, if they choose to take it, to reduce the cost of government."

In this context, it is important to distinguish between regulations which implement federal mandates and those which are issued under authority granted by the federal government.\n\nIt must be noted that recent court cases have held that the threatened loss of federal funds is not equivalent to a federal mandate.\n\nRather than sampling any affected state and/or local entities, it would be appropriate and acceptable for the issuing state agency to either calculate the increased federal fund (based on an established sharing ratio) or to contact the federal agencies involved for their estimates of any fiscal impact.\n\nReductions in Federal Funds\n\nAs with increased federal funds decreases would most likely result for programs involving sharing ratios.

The department identifies program needs in a strategic plan, determines the related infrastructure requirements, prepares a five-year infrastructure plan, prepares individual capital outlay budget change proposals, works with Finance and DGS to budget and implement the plan, and may work with PMIB and STO to provide interim and long-term financing for the project. At all stages of a capital outlay project or a capitalized lease project, departments are responsible for justifying program needs, keeping the project within scope and cost, and meeting administrative requirements set forth in statute and SAM. The following departments have authority to design and construct projects, exclusive of the control or oversight of DGS, with certain limitations: Departments authorized to manage capital outlay projects 0250 – Judicial Branch 3540 – Forestry and Fire Protection (limited authority) 3790 – Parks and Recreation 5225 – Corrections and Rehabilitation 6870 – California Community Colleges 6610 – California State University 6440 – University of California 8940 – California Military Department Although the above departments have authority to manage capital outlay projects exclusive of DGS’ control and oversight, these departments are subject to Finance and PWB control and oversight (special rules apply for the universities). Finance reviews capital outlay budget change proposals (COBCPs) for inclusion in the Governor’s Budget , reviews legislation proposing capital outlay projects and capitalized leases, has authority to adjust the scope of projects subject to legislative reporting requirements, chairs and provides staff to PWB in that board’s oversight of project implementation, and has delegated authority from PWB to carry out certain of the PWB’s tasks. Finance also participates in bond sale activities for capital outlay and capitalized lease projects. PWB acquires property for the state, must approve the preliminary plans or performance criteria for capital projects, may set reasonable conditions for any project, and may issue debt instruments and authorize interim financing to construct facilities. PWB ensures that projects remain within legislatively approved scope and cost and are carried out in a timely manner and with proper due diligence. PWB has authority to augment projects by up to 20 percent, and may terminate projects, under circumstances defined in statute and subject to legislative notification requirements. In addition, the PWB is vested with the power of eminent domain (condemnation authority) for the state entities under its purview. An overview of PWB’s role and responsibilities is presented in SAM Section 6842. DGS has broad authority for real property acquisition, sales, statewide property inventory, and energy efficiency services for state and K-14 school facilities. Its services are offered on a reimbursable basis. DGS determines whether departments are capable of carrying out minor projects directly, and may delegate the management of minor capital projects to departments. Additional information about minor capital outlay projects is provided in Section 6807. DGS is also staff to PWB for property acquisition. The PMIB has the authority to grant requests for Pooled Money Investment Account loans for projects needing interim financing before bonds are sold. Additional information on PMIB is provided in SAM Section 6878. STO is the state’s official agent for the sale of debt instruments. STO chairs the PMIB and sits as a member on the PWB (Bond Items only). In addition, STO provides (or makes arrangements for) trust services for debt issuances. As agent for sale, STO holds the exclusive right to select financing teams for issuances. STO’s agent-for-sale role includes all debt financings of joint powers authorities, regardless of whether the state is a member of the authority. Additional information on STO is provided in SAM Sections 6870–6888."

        "title": "CAPITAL OUTLAY VERSUS STATE OPERATIONS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE",
        "content": "The state appropriates funds in three broad classifications—state operations (support), local assistance, and capital outlay—referred to as the character of appropriation . Unless statutory language specifically allows otherwise, once budgeted as one of the three characters, a program or activity must follow that classification’s expenditure rules. Infrastructure management uses all three characters of appropriation, depending on the activity. The general rule is that the acquisition/creation/renovation of real property is classified as capital outlay when the state holds or has the equivalent of fee ownership. If the state does not hold title to the real property but has a long-term interest in the property, such as a long-term lease, the betterment or improvement of this property may be classified as capital outlay, as determined by Finance. Operation and maintenance of state real assets is classified as state operations. State-funded but locally-owned infrastructure is classified as local assistance.\n\nCertain types of leasing activities—called capitalized leasing—which are funded as state operations can also result in a capital acquisition. As used in this chapter, the term capitalized assets covers both traditional capital outlay as well as capitalized leasing. (Reminder: Capitalized assets are to be reported to the DGS Statewide Property Inventory [SPI] Unit for inclusion in the SPI.)\n\nException to the prohibition against using support funds for capital outlay : Section 6.00 of the Budget Act provides a limited exception to the rule that support funds may not be used for capital outlay purposes. This section allows up to $100,000 of support funds to be encumbered for preliminary plans, working drawings, performance criteria, construction, or design build of any project for the alteration of a state-owned facility upon Finance Approval (Section 6.00 does not apply to leased facilities). This amount may be exceeded only if:\n\nFinance determines the proposed alteration is critical and the use of a higher level of support funds is necessary; and The maximum cost of the project does not exceed $656,000.\n\nFinance must notify the Legislature not less than 30 days in advance when approving more than\n\n$100,000 in support funding for a capital project. Section 6807 on minor capital outlay describes the approval process for projects of more than $100,000. Guidelines for determining character of appropriation: The following discussion and table are intended as a guide to assist departments in determining whether an activity should be budgeted as capital outlay, support, or local assistance. Capital outlay: Section 3.00 of the Budget Act defines capital outlay as the expenditure of funds for the acquisition of land or other real property, major construction, improvements, equipment, designs, specifications, and equipment necessary in connection with a construction or improvement project . Administratively, capital outlay is defined as:\n\nAny real property acquisition or new construction. Any alteration, renovation, addition or betterment (including interior asbestos removal/remodeling) which extends the design life or alters/upgrades the function of a structure. This does not include repairs and maintenance, which are intended to keep a facility functional at its designed level of services and life expectancy. Alteration means any modification of existing space (buildings, structures or other facilities) that changes the use as to function, layout, capacity, or quality. Typical alterations include demolition of fixed partitions and/or construction of new fixed partitions or initial installation of carpeting and movable partitions. However, there are two instances in which alterations may be done with state operations funding: In a leased space situation, the landlord generally makes the alterations and amortizes them through the lease. The lease, including increases for amortized alterations or lump-sum payment for alterations, is a state operations expense subject to the support budget review process; and As noted in preceding text, Section 6.00 of the Budget Act allows the use of the support appropriation for alterations, within specified limits. Betterment means any modification that increases the designed level of services or life expectancy of a facility or other state infrastructure (e.g. seismic improvements, upgrades, etc.) Fixed and movable equipment needed for initial occupancy of a new facility or space, but usually only if the new facility is not replacing an existing facility (see 6806 Illustration). Fixed equipment is referred to as Group 1 equipment, and movable equipment is referred to as Group 2 equipment (Section 6855). A lease-purchase (installment payment) agreement. Although the actual lease payments will be budgeted in state operations, the transaction is a capitalized assets acquisition, and because equity is built as payments are made. All planned lease-purchases, whether authorized through the budget or special legislation, must be included in the department’s five-year capitalized assets plan. If the lease-purchase will be authorized through the Budget Act, a COBCP is required to verify economic benefits, whether or not there is a related support BCP for lease costs. (For lease-purchase agreements authorized through special legislation, Finance may require information similar in content to a COBCP at the proposed legislation stage.) These requirements apply to lease-purchases for state infrastructure financed through a joint powers authority, another level of government, or a private developer (Sections 6818 and 6820). Both the request for, and the exercise of, a purchase option. A lease with a purchase option gives the state the right, during the course of the lease, to purchase the asset for a predetermined price, if desired, which is a capital outlay acquisition. Adding a purchase option in a lease agreement is considered initiating a potential capital outlay acquisition. Although the lease payments prior to the exercise of the option are classified as state operations, the potential acquisition must be tracked as part of the department’s overall capitalized asset plan. Therefore, if authorization is sought through the Budget Act, anticipated purchase options and their exercise must both be presented for review as COBCPs, subject to dollar thresholds noted in Sections 6818 and 6820. Regardless of method of authorization, the planned use of purchase options must be included in the department’s five-year infrastructure plan. Generally, the following are not considered capital outlay: relocation (including temporary swing space while a project is under construction) and moving expenses, although Finance may authorize moving expenses as a capital outlay cost on a case-by-case basis.\n\nState operations : The following facility-related expenses are classified as state operations:\n\nReplacement equipment items (regardless of amount). Repair projects, including special repairs, not connected with a construction or improvement project. Examples of special repair projects include repainting, re-roofing, electrical rewiring, plumbing repairs, dredging of river or stream beds to restore original flow capacity, replacing old equipment items, and road repairs. (Regardless of amount, special repairs are budgeted in the department’s state operations appropriation.) Maintenance, including deferred maintenance. Maintenance is budgeted as facilities operations in the department’s operating expense schedule. Most relocation costs—including temporary―”swing” space—and moving expenses, whether or not related to a capital outlay project. Exceptions to this must be approved by Finance. Lease or rental costs, and associated budget requests. (However, as noted in the preceding text, capitalized leasing must be reflected in the five-year capitalized asset plan and COBCPs are required under specified conditions per Section 6818.) Generally NOT alterations in state-owned buildings, except as provided in Section 6.00 of the Budget (see preceding). In leased facilities, support funds may be used for alterations.\n\nLocal assistance : The following infrastructure-related expense is classified as local assistance:\n\nGrants to local agencies for the operation, maintenance, and acquisition or development of facilities or land, provided the local entity retains ownership after completion of the project.\n\nILLUSTRATION DISTINCTION BETWEEN CAPITAL OUTLAY AND STATE OPERATIONS DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT 1/ STATE OPERATIONS CAPITAL OUTLAY OPERATING EXPENSES AND EQUIPMENT PROJECT LEVEL MINOR PROJECTS MAJOR PROJECTS Construction projects: New construction, alteration 2/ , or betterment of existing structure.

        "content": "Minor capital outlay is any project under $656,000 (except an acquisition project) which is scheduled in the Budget Act specifically as minor capital outlay. However, Resources Agency capital outlay projects of up to $903,000 may be proposed as minor projects with the concurrence of DOF (Public Contract Code 10108.5). The $903,000 limit does not apply to district agricultural associations or the State Lands Commission. Important budgeting points include : Per Section 3.00 of the Budget Act, the term minor projects includes planning, working drawings, construction, improvements, and equipment projects not specifically set forth in the budget schedule. It does not include any acquisition project, regardless of amount. Minor projects are generally budgeted in a single schedule. Any project not scheduled specifically as a minor project, regardless of amount, is a major project. (The decision on how to propose scheduling the project is determined by Finance.) DGS may delegate the authority to individual departments to carry out a minor project directly, pursuant to the Public Contract Code Section 10808 and 10808.5. Per Section 1.80 of the Budget Act, the period of appropriation availability for minor projects is one year, followed by a two-year liquidation period. (Major projects have up to three years of expenditure availability.) A minor project is not subject to PWB oversight. Consequently, by practice, PWB will not augment minor projects since they are not subject to the PWB approval processes. Finance may increase the approved amount of a minor capital outlay project through a redirection within the minor program if the project is not scheduled individually and the amount of the increase does not result in a project of over $656,000. Substitution of minor projects is permissible with Finance concurrence and based on critical need. A complete COBCP (Section 6818) for the new project is required when requesting the substitution of a minor project along with all other justification. Minor projects may be subject to provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as described in Section 6850. Each year, Finance issues a budget letter requesting the submission of all minor project budget requests. Each proposed project must be submitted in the format for major projects outlined in Section 6818. Reappropriation of minor projects is not generally permitted. Minor projects should be projects where all funds can be encumbered in one year. It is not permissible to “piecemeal” larger projects through several minor projects.\n\nMinor projects created through Section 6.00 of the Budget Act : As described in Section 6806, a minor project may be created for alteration of a state facility using support funds , subject to Finance approval when the total project amount is between $100,000 and $656,000.\n\nThe request must include all the information required in a COBCP (Section 6818). The request must be submitted at least 60 days in advance of proposed project implementation (30 days for Finance to review the request and notify the Legislature; 30 days for the Legislature’s review), and no later than April 30 of each year. (Submit copies of the request to both the Finance support analyst and the Capital Outlay Unit, along with any related Form 22 for transfer of funds to DGS’ Architecture Revolving Fund.)"

For projects implemented through multiple or phase appropriations, parts of Phase 3 will need to be repeated for each appropriation. Note that this description of the capital outlay process is based on the standard design- bid-build approach to project delivery. Other project delivery methods, such as the design-build approach, have slightly different project phases. Section 6842 discusses project delivery systems. Reference to DGS in the following text applies to any department authorized to act as its own project manager.\n\nConcept and documentation phase: 2 to 5 months (Sections 6816–6821) Client department defines problem and develops conceptual solution. Client department collects supporting data and documents how the project supports the department’s strategic plan. Client department documents findings and conclusions in its five-year plan and COBCPs. Historical resources phase : Usually coincides with phases 1 and 3 (Section 6822) Client department submits proposed project and Historic Resources Inventory to State Historic Preservation Officer for review if the project will impact a state- owned structure over 50 years of age. The State Historic Preservation Officer may propose mitigations which, if unacceptable to the department, must be mediated by Office of Planning and Research. Budget approval phase: 17 months (Section 6814 describes the budget enactment timetable; Sections 6824–6832 gives detailed descriptions of processes). DOF reviews the five-year plan and COBCPs, including their relationship to the department’s strategic plan. DGS prepares a technical feasibility review for the project, if requested by DOF. DGS develops budget packages, as requested by DOF. DOF conducts scope meetings, as required. DOF conducts Administration budget hearings and includes approved COBCPs in the Governor’s Budget . The Legislative Analyst comments on selected projects in The Analysis of the Budget Bill . Policy or technical changes to capital outlay projects proposed in the Governor’s Budget are submitted by Finance Letter to the Legislature. The Legislature holds budget subcommittee and conference committee hearings, and approves the capital outlay budget, with any revisions. After reducing or vetoing selected appropriations in the enrolled bill, the Governor signs the measure. Site selection and acquisition phase: Up to 12 months (Section 6849) Client department and DGS make site selection. PWB approves site selection. As PWB’s agent, DGS acquires property (through the exercise of eminent domain, if needed). PWB approves settlement price, if any. Environmental review phase : May coincide with phases 1 through 4 (Section 6850) Department meets the CEQA requirements. By policy, if land is purchased as part of a project, CEQA requirements must be completed before acquisition. Otherwise, environmental review must be completed by the end of Phase 6. Preliminary plan phase: 3 to 12 months (Section 6851) Design architect/engineer prepares schematic documents. Design architect/engineer prepares design development and estimate of project costs. Environmental process certified by department. PWB approves preliminary plan design . Working drawing phase: 3 to 11 months (Section 6852) Design architect/engineer prepares plans and specifications for bidding and construction work and refines the cost estimate . Responsible lead design agency obtains mandatory review and approvals (e.g., State Fire Marshal). DGS submits the design certification to DOF . DOF approves working drawings and proceeding to bid . Bidding phase: 3 to 6 months (Sections 6852 and 6853) DGS advertises the project for construction bids. Interested bidders prepare and submit construction bids to DGS. DOF authorizes award (if within approved funding levels) and approves transfer of construction funds . DGS awards construction contract to contractor. Construction phase: 3 to 36 months (Section 6854) Contractor constructs project. DGS processes construction progress payments and change orders within approved contingency amount . DGS files contract completion notice with DOF . Claims and close-out phase: (Section 6856) Contractor files notice of claims. DGS and contractor resolve claims through arbitration, mediation, and/or court. DGS closes-out project per Government Code 14959.\n\nProjects funded through bonds and financing leases have additional administrative steps addressed in Sections 6870–6888. Project changes for cost and scope are addressed in Sections 6861 and 6863, respectively."

        "content": "No base budget for capital outlay . Capital outlay budgets are zero-based each year. This means the department must submit a written capital outlay budget change proposal (COBCP) for each new project or subsequent phase of an existing project for which the department would like funding. The requirements for COBCPs are presented in Section 6818. When COBCPs are due . In general, COBCPs for major and minor capital outlay projects are due to Finance in early August of each year for the fiscal year commencing 11 months later. See Section 6814 for an overview of the budget enactment timetable. See Section 6816 for a listing of documents in addition to COBCPs required to request capital outlay funding. Scope Meetings. Departments may be requested to schedule meetings and/or arrange site visits to help Finance clarify and evaluate project necessity and scope of their COBCPs. Participants usually include Finance capital outlay staff, department staff, and the Department of General Services (DGS). The scope meeting establishes a common understanding among all parties about project scope and priority. Scope is defined in Section 6863. When COBCPs are updated . New project proposals, unless of a truly urgent nature, are usually not accepted after initial submittal of the COBCPs and five-year plan in August. However, each COBCP submission is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and exceptions can be made to allow for a spring submission if the request is deemed critical and cannot wait until the next fall submission deadline. Cost updates received from DGS (based on budget package estimates) will be incorporated into the Governor’s Budget if received by late October. Otherwise, technical cost updates will be presented to the Legislature through a Finance Letter due to the Legislature no later than May 1. If possible, technical updates should be made by the April 1 deadline for spring Finance Letters. Requests accepted at May 1 may be rolled into the overall May Revision process at the discretion of Finance. Scope changes to existing projects, or new projects justified on an urgency basis, may be presented to the Legislature in a Finance Letter due no later than April 1. Department requests for technical and policy Finance Letters are generally due in mid-February; specific due dates are published annually in a Finance Budget Letter. An updated or new COBCP may be required for policy and technical Finance Letters. COBCPs must clearly support the department’s plan . Each department must have a strategic plan, and its COBCPs must demonstrate the relationship and relevancy on how the project supports the implementation of its strategic plan. Five-year infrastructure plans are required annually . Each department submitting a COBCP must also submit, at the same time, a five-year infrastructure plan that includes the specific projects it intends to pursue in the following five-year time period. The requirements for this plan are set out in Section 6820. A copy of the five-year plan is due simultaneously to the LAO. Exceptions to project-level plans must be approved by Finance. Annual Budget Letters for COBCPs and five-year plans . Finance releases a Budget Letter each July setting specific due dates for COBCPs and five-year plans, reiterating information requirements, and describing any form or processing changes. A separate Budget Letter is released in January setting due dates for requests for Finance Letters the following Spring to make policy or technical changes to capital outlay projects proposed in the Governor’s Budget . Another Budget Letter is released biannually in the spring publishing the updated cost indexes used to adjust construction costs for inflation. Capital Outlay augmentations . If a project is anticipated to exceed its budget, the remedies are a scope reduction (subject to approval by Finance and legislative notification) and/or an augmentation of up to 20 percent (subject to approval by the PWB and when required, legislative notification). If those remedies are insufficient, the remaining options are to terminate the project or halt it while seeking a new or supplemental appropriation. Augmentations and scope changes are discussed in Sections 6861 and 6863. No transfer of capital outlay funds between scheduled projects. The annual Budget Act includes control section language (Sec. 26.00) forbidding the transfer of funds between scheduled projects in a department’s capital outlay item. There may be some exceptions on an item-by-item basis; however, the PWB retains the authority to augment a project’s appropriation, provided there are sufficient resources available in the source fund. CEQA review required . The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires environmental review of any project undertaken in whole or in part by any public agency. See Section 6850 for more information. Process exceptions for certain departments. The University of California, the California State University, California Community Colleges, some Resources Agency departments, and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation may handle the design and construction of their own projects without using the services of the Department of General Services. In addition, the Department of Water Resources (for the State Water Project) and the Department of Transportation (for highway-related projects) are not subject to the instructions contained in this chapter."

        "content": "A COBCP (or an updated COBCP) is required for:\n\nAny request for a capital outlay appropriation or appropriation , whether for acquisition of land or structures or for construction. (Definitions of what cost elements are classified as capital outlay are provided in Section 6806.) A COBCP is also required for project augmentations which exceed the Public Works Board’s (PWB) authority (i.e., more than 20 percent of the original appropriation). See Section 6861. Requests for Finance Letters to adjust an existing project proposal, whether for technical or policy reasons, or to add an urgent new proposal. Entering into a lease with purchase option . Although no capital expenditure is made when entering into a lease with a purchase option, the potential for a capital acquisition is created. At the time the department submits a STD. 9 space action request for Finance review, it must demonstrate that it has analyzed the potential alternatives (state construction, lease-purchase agreement, pure lease) and selected the best alternative. For projects then seeking statutory authority for the purchase option through the Budget Act, the cost-benefit or economic analysis must be updated and presented as a COBCP . (A COBCP is required whether or not there is a related support BCP for lease costs.) For projects seeking purchase option authority through special legislation, similar information will be required as part of Finance’s review of proposed legislation. For projects under $2 million, DGS has general statutory authority for purchase options (Government Code Section 14669 ). Exercising a purchase option on capital assets. Exercising a purchase option (even if a nominal amount) requires a capital outlay appropriation. This also includes trailers and relocatable or modular buildings. At the time the acquisition appropriation is requested, the department submits an updated COBCP with an economic analysis showing that the proposed purchase is still cost-beneficial, considering any changes in program need, lease market conditions, and state construction alternatives. Entering into a lease-purchase agreement for capital assets. Although no capital expenditure is made under a lease-purchase agreement, a capital acquisition occurs. If the authorization for a lease-purchase is sought through the Budget Act, the department must submit a COBCP comparing alternatives to meeting its space requirements and demonstrating that a lease-purchase agreement is the most cost- beneficial. Entering into any other lease which meets the definition of capitalized lease, and where authority is sought through the Budget Act . A lease agreement is a capitalized lease (an “in-substance purchase”) when substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership are assumed by the lessee. If a lease meets any one of the following condition s, it is a capitalized lease: Ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the state at the end of the lease period. The lease gives the lessee the option of purchasing the leased asset at a nominal value at some point during or at the end of the lease period. The period of the lease (a single term of a lease, not including renewals) is 75 percent or more of the estimated useful life of the leased asset. The present value of the sum of the minimum lease payments is 90 percent or more of the fair market value of the leased asset (i.e., the lease payments over a single term of the lease are substantially the same as the purchase price). Unless existing statute authorizes a capitalized lease (for example, Government Code Section 14669 for DGS), the lease requires specific authority. If the Budget Act will be used to provide that authority, a COBCP is required whether or not a capital outlay appropriation is needed. Minor alterations projects authorized by Section 6.00 of the Budget Act . Section 6.00 projects which require Finance approval and legislative notification must be submitted for review to the Finance Capital Outlay Unit with a signed letter justifying the criticality of the project. For more information, refer to Section 6806.\n\nAdditionally, if a support budget increase is needed as a result of a capital outlay project—including for rent increases pursuant to a lease—a support BCP must also be submitted separately to the appropriate Finance support unit.\n\nTimelines for submitting and updating COBCPs.\n\nSubmission Date: The deadline for submitting COBCPs is generally early August for the fall and mid-February for the spring process (the specific dates are published in a Finance Budget Letter).\n\nProject costs are adjusted in the fall prior to the budget year, using budget packages prepared by DGS and submitted by the department. (See Section 6814 for time- frames.) This information is given directly to Finance by DGS.\n\nFinal budget package estimates are sometimes not available in time to include in the Governor’s Budget . Therefore, Finance annually prepares a Finance Letter for technical adjustments to capital outlay projects which is due to the Legislature by May 1 before the budget year. However, Finance generally will include such adjustments as part of the April 1 Finance Letter. The departments must request technical changes in writing, using a COBCP format, generally no later than mid-February (the specific date is published in a Finance Budget Letter). Finance Letters proposed by the Administration are reviewed by the Legislature in conjunction with the Governor’s Budget .\n\nThe Finance Letter process may also be used to propose scope changes to projects in the Governor’s Budget , to add new (urgent) projects, or to accelerate project phases. These are termed “policy changes” and are due to the Legislature by April 1. The due date for requests from departments is the same as for technical changes (i.e., mid- February). An updated or new COBCP is required for policy Finance Letters.\n\nAn overview of the project phases—including the budget approval phase—is provided in Section 6809. A timetable for budget preparation and enactment is provided in Section 6814.\n\nInstructions to complete a COBCP. The COBCP form can be found on Finance’s website: http://www.dof.ca.gov/Budget/Resources_for_Departments/Budget_Forms/Documents/DF-151_Capital_Outlay_Budget_Change_Proposal-COBCP.docx\n\nAdditionally, helpful resources for writing effective Budget Change Proposals can be found here: http://dof.ca.gov/budget/resources_for_departments/budget_analyst_guide/effective_BCPs.html\n\nThe information required to complete a COBCP can be found below.\n\nPurpose of project: What is the problem? What is the underlying program need or infrastructure deficiency?\n\nExplain a program-based need by relating the infrastructure request to the program that the real property serves. (The Capital Outlay Unit of Finance will verify program- driven needs with the department’s Finance support analyst.) At a minimum, address: The program change. The overall infrastructure requirement related to that change. Capacity requirements : Express capacity (total size) needs in terms of patients housed, inmates, full-time equivalents (FTEs), office space requirements, or other accepted “units” for the program. Some programs are required to use specific Finance-generated data for enrollment or growth, or to use “capacity” measurements approved by Finance and/or the Legislature. If reference is made to any space or cost studies, append these to the COBCP. Special space requirements : All special purpose rooms and offices must be fully described by purpose, square footage, and need (based on program requirements). What the project accomplishes towards that infrastructure requirement. For projects providing an increment towards an overall goal (such as total acreage of wetlands) specify: What portion of the requirement has already been met; How much the project would add; and What the remaining need will be and how the department proposes to meet that need. If the need is not program related, explain the real property deficiency in terms of specific mechanical/electrical system inadequacies, code requirements, maintenance/repair difficulties, etc. Include copies of the State Fire Marshal citations, the Department of Health Services citations, surveys, or other documents to substantiate need.\n\nRelationship of Project to Strategic Plan : Explain the project’s relevancy to the department’s strategic plan. Projects which lack a clear supporting relationship to the department’s strategic plan will be returned.\n\nAlternatives: Present all reasonable alternatives to solve the problem. In developing potential alternatives, address the following questions:\n\nProgram delivery: are there different ways to achieve the same program outcomes? Is there more than one potential site? What are the required site characteristics? Given a specific site, are there alternative facility solutions? For new construction or capitalized leasing proposals, submit an economic analysis comparing facility alternatives over a 25-year period (i.e., compare straight lease, lease-purchase, new building construction, renovation of existing facility, etc.). What are the alternative funding solutions? Which state funds sources are available? Are funding partnerships feasible with other state agencies or other levels of government? What other management factors are critical in selecting an alternative? For each alternative, provide the following information in brief : Description of alternative; Overview of scope; Total cost of all phases of the project (use only approved cost indices, and identify both short term and life-cycle costs); Funding source, including project eligibility for that source; Summary of related program benefits and costs (include impacts on the support budget such as personnel years and operating costs specific to the program). Indicate if a support BCP will be required, and when; and Summary of facility management benefits, such as impact on the department’s maintenance budget, extension of the facility’s design life, etc.\n\nRecommended Solution and Why :\n\nWhich is the best alternative, and why? Describe the recommended alternative in detail . This description is the basis on which initial scope will be defined.\n\nAll factors influencing site selection must be fully justified . For land acquisition projects where a specific site is already selected , identify why that site is critical. Address landscape character; existing resource values; existing access, utilities and structures (and how they would be used); and statewide significance. If the recommended solution is not the least expensive, describe the factors/benefits that justify the extra cost. (This justification could address life cycle savings, support budget offsets, or other program/management factors.) Provide a detailed scope description. Include: Specific program needs to be addressed through the project, including: proposed size (number of stories, gross and usable/assignable square feet, etc.); special features (food service, auditoriums, child care facilities, etc.); special Group 1 or Group 2 equipment needs; types of basic materials to be used if known; and any other items that will allow full understanding of the proposed project. Include any project drawings or renderings if available. Specific location of the project, including a vicinity map that describes the area served. If the project is for a replacement facility, explain how Group 2 replacement equipment will be funded. For land acquisition projects, an inventory of existing structures and the approximate appraised value of each parcel (or group of parcels), including the basis for the appraisal (staff appraisals, previous sales, AIA appraisal, etc.). Upon formal request, DGS will assist departments in preparing this information (specifically, parcel values, site selection factors and the economic analysis). Provide a proposed project time schedule that takes into consideration the environmental review process. Section 6846 describes the required format. Provide full cost information. Approximate cost by phase, indicating the basis on which the estimate was prepared. If costs are based on a previously developed budget package, append that package to the COBCP. Note if costs have been adjusted for inflation and on what basis, (i.e., which specific CCCI). A proposed funding source for each phase, including identification of any funding partners at the federal, state or local level. A complete funding history, including all previous submissions and any other data to completely describe past project history and future funding requirements. Section 6845 Illustration 2 describes the required format. Describe the impacts on the support budget. Include an analysis that identifies future maintenance and operation costs (in operating expenses and personnel years). Identify the proposed source of funds. Note whether a support BCP will be needed concurrently or in the future. Identify potential cost savings and/or potential revenues or reimbursements with proposed disposition and the basis for calculation. Identify and explain any project risks. If the project was previously rejected by either the Administration or the Legislature for any reason other than lack of funding, explain the basis of the rejection and any significant project changes from the previous submission. List coordination responsibilities with other state agencies and levels of government, including any mandatory reviews and approvals . Impacts on other departments. Required coordination with the State Historic Preservation Officer (see Section 6822). CEQA requirements as described in Section 6850. Note any probable opposition to CEQA approvals (SAM sections 1000–1099). Clearances required from planning or review agencies such as the State Fire Marshal, the State Coastal Commission, local jurisdiction general plans, etc. List all items proposed for agency retention. Agency-retained items are project elements which the department rather than the architect/engineer or contractor provides. Typical examples include movable equipment, installation, resource protection, etc. Finance approval of a DF-14D (Section 6845, Illustration 1) is required before the department may commence these activities. Identify whether this includes department personnel costs.\n\nTechnical Notes:\n\nCapital outlay projects which include an information technology (IT) component must also comply with the IT reporting requirements contained in Sections 4800–5953 and Sections 6000–6965 of the State Administrative Manual. Examples of IT activities typically included in capital outlay projects include: the purchase and/or upgrade of IT equipment or software; the installation and/or upgrade of telecommunications equipment (excluding voice only); or the installation and/or upgrade of local area network equipment or software. The Department of Information Technology (DOIT) is responsible for the review and approval of IT activities from a technology feasibility perspective; the Technology Investment Review Unit of Finance reviews IT proposals from a business cost/benefits perspective. In both cases, the review vehicle is the feasibility study report (FSR). Questions regarding DOIT’s IT reporting requirements should be directed to DOIT. All IT reporting requirements must be met before the IT component of a capital outlay project may be approved . Group 2 equipment phases of projects . Group 1, fixed equipment, is incorporated into or attached to the facility and therefore is included in the construction phase of a project. Group 2, movable equipment, is budgeted as a separate phase. For a COBCP requesting the Group 2 equipment phase of a project, provide the project appropriation history, including the project name, budget act items, and project code. Definitions of Group 1 and Group 2 equipment are provided in Section 6855. For Group 2 equipment, identify how funding needs were determined. Show all items of equipment to be placed in a room, indicating whether the item is to be purchased by the agency or transferred from another building or location. Account for all equipment currently available in buildings to be replaced by the new structure. Final approval of equipment lists generally follows approval of preliminary plans. Exceptions to this rule are discussed in Section 6855. Movable equipment which does not meet the definition of capital outlay per Section 6806 is not proposed in a COBCP. These costs are proposed and funded in the state operations appropriation (i.e. they require a support budget change proposal). Coordination of STD. 9s with COBCPs and BCPs : Departments submit space action requests ( STD. 9s ) for: New or additional space (including swing space), lease extensions, or renewals desired by an agency in no institutional buildings—whether state-owned or leased, and Relocatable buildings and trailers. Finance approval of a STD. 9 does not constitute approval for a support budget increase or a capital outlay appropriation, or approval to include authorization language for a lease-purchase, purchase option, or option execution in the Budget Act. If any of these is required, either a support BCP or a COBCP (or both) must be submitted to Finance. SAM Section 6453 provides additional information. Architectural and engineering (A&E) fees: A&E fees (basic and non-basic) are charged for architectural and engineering work performed either by the department or by consulting professionals. Expenses may also include project-related construction management support, such as construction inspection, travel, bidding expenses, and drawings. Generally, A&E fees do not exceed 13 percent of the proposed construction contract amounts (excluding construction contingencies) . Special items exceeding 13 percent (such as services related to asbestos or seismic) should be separately identified in the COBCPs . Contact the DGS Customer Account Management Branch for assistance with budgeting A&E fees. Swing space for capital outlay projects : Swing space, i.e., temporary accommodations during a facility remodel, is a state operations cost which should be noted informationally on the COBCP but requested separately as a support BCP. Allowable cost indices: Departments must use the California Construction Cost Index (CCCI). Use of any other index requires Finance concurrence. Each July, Finance releases a Budget Letter identifying the approved CCCI to be used when updating COBCPs for the following fiscal year (Section 6812)."

The objective of the study is to understand the project’s feasibility and to refine the project cost estimates. Finance then uses this information along with a revised Project Cost Summary (6828 Illustration 1), prepared by DGS, for budgetary decision making purposes.\n\nBUDGET PACKAGES\n\nA budget package is the formal output used to communicate the information gathered during the study phase. The budget package is distributed to DGS, departments, and Finance. DGS will often prepare, and facilitate the completion of, budget packages for state departments; however, the following entities are authorized, by statute, to prepare their own budget packages: higher education, the Department of Water Resources, and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (for new prison construction.) See Section 6847 for the process of transferring funds to DGS for new projects or phases of work, such as a study.\n\nPROJECT COST SUMMARY\n\nCompleted budget packages/studies must be accompanied by a Project Cost Summary when they are completed and submitted to Finance and the department (if DGS is completing the budget package) for review. DGS prepares the Project Cost Summary from information provided by the department, in scoping meetings, during the environmental review process, and from data compiled during the budget package/study feasibility review process (if any). See 6828 Illustration 2 for a description of the categories included in the Project Cost Summary. Any department authorized to act as its own project manager is required to provide equivalent information using the same format and business process described in this section\n\n6828 Illustration 1 Tables\n\n6828 Illustration 2\n\nProject Cost Summary\n\nEvery project should be analyzed individually to determine the appropriate fees based on the scope, location, duration, staffing levels, and disciplines required to complete the project.\n\nArchitectural and Engineering (A&E) Design (All Phases)\n\nA&E fees are based on the project’s scope and are determined by a detailed task analysis of each participating design discipline (architecture, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical engineering, and estimating). This analysis considers, among other factors, the hours required to prepare a set of design (preliminary plans) and construction (working drawings) documents, provide construction support, and complete as-built drawing preparation. No two projects are the same. While there may be design similarities (prototypes), each design and construction project must be developed based upon the specific site, the department and their programmatic needs, and current code and executive order/directive requirements (i.e. clean energy).\n\nAdditional fees for renovations may be required depending on complexity, hazardous materials, and historical requirements of the project.\n\nConstruction Inspection/Travel/Guarantee (Construction Phase)\n\nInspection fees are calculated on individual project needs and will vary depending on the size, type, duration, construction value, and location, as well as the services requested. Essential Services, Field Act, and Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) projects will tend to have a higher fee based on the nature of the increased level of inspection and documentation required by the applicable regulatory agencies. Inspection also covers contract and code compliance at the project site as well as coordinating any regulatory or special inspections.\n\nAdvertising/Printing (Working Drawings Phase)\n\nThese costs are based upon the locality of the project, the number of newspapers that will receive ads, and the advertising rate. There are two paid advertisements for a project in each paper. These ads are also posted online and in magazines. Some large projects may require more extensive advertising. Printing costs include the production of plans and specifications as needed for the project team.\n\nSpecial Consultants (All Phases)\n\nThis category is calculated based on the project scope, location, and duration and may consist of the following disciplines: commissioning, Leadership in Energy and environmental Design (LEED), Zero Net Energy, hazardous material/air monitoring, survey, geotechnical, traffic, kitchen, cultural/biological/archeological, aviation, security, landscape, telecom, urban/land planning, constructability, fire life safety, and healthcare.\n\nMaterials Testing (Construction Phase)\n\nThis category is calculated based on individual project requirements and may include special inspection requirements. Tests may include the measurement of material characteristics, such as properties, structure, and composition. The data and test results determine whether materials, fasteners, and treatments meet the requirements of design engineers and regulatory agencies, and are suitable for their intended application.\n\nProject/Construction Management (PCM) (All Phases)\n\nPCM costs are based on scope, complexity, location, and duration of a project. Project manager travel time and the time associated with managing the project from the planning and design phases through project closeout and occupancy are part of these costs as well.\n\nServices may include:\n\nScope management Cost management Schedule management Document management Quality control Optimizing strategies for procurement and phasing construction Closeout and document turnover Transition to occupancy\n\nContract Construction Management (Working Drawing and Construction Phase)\n\nContract Construction Management firms may be utilized to supplement PCM staff on large and/or complex projects. Fees on smaller projects will be used for specialized services such as pre-bid/construction activities, schedule analysis, cost estimating, and document management, etc.\n\nSite Acquisition Cost & Fees (Acquisition Phase)\n\nServices related to the acquisition of a proposed property such as an appraisal, an appraisal review, real estate due diligence services, site testing, environmental studies, relocation assistance, and easement or property rights issues are included in site acquisition costs and fees. Design services like legal descriptions, site testing, and environmental studies will be provided by the A&E team.\n\nAgency Retained Items (All Phases)\n\nThe Agency Retained category are project-specific items that may include modular and institutional furniture, guarding costs, agency staff time, and equipment.\n\nSmall Business Enterprise/Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Assessment\n\n(SAM Section 8752, Full Cost Recovery) (Construction Phase)\n\nRefers to fee that is applied to all consultants and contracts used throughout all project phases.\n\nDivision of the State Architect (DSA) structural and fire life safety checking refer to DSA Fee calculator on DGS’ website for the costs associated with DSA Services.

This report includes outstanding issues and recommendations for the mitigation of any known condition on the parcel area which may affect the financing, value, desirability, or utility of the project site. The A&E consultant is responsible for providing preliminary reports, copies of all vesting and reference documents, title exceptions maps, project maps, vicinity maps, and written legal descriptions/sketches. For lease revenue bond funded projects, the A&E service support need may run up to the time of the bond sale for the project.\n\nDuring the review process there will be an attempt to clear minor property rights and other real estate due diligence issues. Clearing substantial issues such as those requiring abandonment or relocation of existing road/utility right-of-way, recordation of correction deeds to perfect title, establishment of the property’s boundary lines, quit claiming surface or mineral rights, quit claiming interests held by outside parties, and condemnation actions need to be included as required.\n\nState-owned leases that encumber a project site may require modification and consent of the SPWB if the project is a lease revenue bond funded project.\n\nState Fire Marshal (SFM) Fees (Health and Safety Code, §13109 Health and Safety Code, §13145 and 13146) (All Phases)\n\nPlans are reviewed for compliance with the adopted State of California Building and Fire Codes, California Code of Regulation, Title 19, Title 24, and applicable nationally recognized standards. Plan review consists of, but is not limited to, preliminary review, design development consultations, initial review, conferences, back check, addendums, change orders, instructional bulletins, and requests for information. SFM provides field inspection for code compliance during the construction phase of the project. The SFM must issue a Temporary and/or Final Certification of Occupancy of the project before the project can be occupied for its intended use.\n\nPermit/Regulatory/Utility Fees (All Phases)\n\nAs required by the project scope:\n\nElectrical service Water service Storm water discharge State/City/County Fee Mitigation Others as determined"

        "content": "This section addresses the FI$Cal coding structures for project identification numbers, categories, and phases. Project identification numbers. The objective of project identification numbers is to: Provide consistency in project identification across fiscal years and in the various automated state budgetary and accounting systems; Provide unique project identification from start to finish, eliminating the need to assign different codes to phases or appropriations of a specific project; and Eliminate code duplication. Phases of work necessary to implement projects are not separate projects and are not given separate project identification numbers. Land acquisitions associated with capital outlay projects use the same number as the balance of the project. However, a general acquisition for habitat or recreation may be treated as a separate project and be given a separate number. Project identification number structure . The FI$Cal project identification number, as shown in the Governor’s Budget and Budget Act, and as utilized by the State Controller’s Office and departments, is a nine-digit auto generated number that is established in PeopleSoft when a new project is created. Therefore, there is no way to select or standardize project identification numbers. Note that the first three numbers (usually zeros) of a project identification number are excluded in the Budget Act and other budget publications as these publications are designed to only use a seven-digit project identification number. Project Categories . Beginning with the 2017-18 Budget, all capital outlay expenditures are budgeted to the same category. Therefore, the only way to delineate project expenditures is by phase. Project categories describe functional purpose. Use the following coding structure for COBCPs (Section 6818) and in the five-year capitalized assets plans (Section 6820). Note that these categories can be found, and should be updated, in the Project Details tab in Hyperion. FLS Fire Life Safety .

Examples include savings, cost avoidance, or revenue generation . Phases . Phases describe the activity to be funded within the sequences of activities, from project inception to completion. Not all projects require studies, acquisition, or equipment to complete the project. Some projects are solely for acquisition (either property—such as wetlands or a park—or improvements). Prior to the 2018-19 Budget, if multiple phases of funding were included in an appropriation, the funding by phase did not have to be scheduled separately (i.e. $1 million for acquisition, preliminary plans, and working drawings). However, beginning with the 2018-19 Budget, each phase of funding must be scheduled separately (i.e. $100,000 acquisition, $300,000 preliminary plans, and $600,000 working drawings).

        "title": "METHODS OF PROJECT DELIVERY",
        "content": "The state traditionally uses the design-bid-build method of procuring design and construction services for most of its capital outlay projects. In addition, the state also uses various lease methods to obtain the use of facilities, both with and without facility acquisition at some point in the lease. The following discussion briefly outlines standard procurement methods in the building industry and the resulting budget implications.\n\nDesign-bid-build . The state’s contract law and budget processes for capital outlay are based on design-bid-build processes because that approach allows the state to determine the exact product before it begins construction. Projects are not bid on by construction contractors until working drawings are completed by a separate architect-engineering firm.\n\nIn the traditional design-bid-build process, preliminary plans, working drawings, and construction are all separate phases; an overview of all typical capital outlay phases is provided in Section 6808. Funds are not normally committed to a phase unless there is a strong assurance that they can be encumbered within a single fiscal year. Consequently, most design-bid-build projects are budgeted in several phases over two to three years (sometimes longer). Each separate appropriation requires a COBCP (Section 6818) and must be included in the client department’s five-year capitalized assets plan (Section 6820).\n\nIn addition, PWB and DOF perform an oversight role for design-bid-build projects by reviewing and approving the design phases of a proposed project (Sections 6842 and 6851).\n\nDesign-build . In design-build projects, design work is performed by the same entity that constructs the project, and the design-build contract award is made in a lump sum.\n\nConsequently, there are no separate phases—or appropriations—for preliminary plans, working drawings, and construction. The client is responsible for providing a project definition which the design-build firm uses as the basis for its bid. The advantage of the design-build approach is that the project delivery team has single-point responsibility for the project. This helps expedite construction time-frames and may reduce the number of change orders.\n\nThere are variations of design-build in which the project definition is elaborated through more detailed narrative specifications and/or drawings. This modified approach is called bridging design-build and for some projects may result in project performance specifications that are nearly as detailed as preliminary plans. Greater specificity is helpful when program needs reduce the range of acceptable design solutions or materials. From a budget perspective, the development of performance specifications may require a separate phase appropriation since the level of detail required could substantially exceed that of a budget package (Section 6828).\n\nState contract law currently does not support the design-build process, except for the California State University and the University of California which have specific design-build authority. Similarly, the PWB process does not presently recognize an alternative to preliminary plans approval.\n\nTurnkey, Design-Build-Lease, Lease-Purchase. These are financing methods in which an owner retains an entity which has single-point responsibility for developing a project. In addition to design and construction, the selected entity is responsible for providing one or more other project development functions, such as selecting and acquiring a site, financing, and even owning or operating the facility which is leased to the client department (with or without an option to purchase). From a budget perspective, these financing approaches are subject to this chapter if they meet the definition of a capitalized lease (Section 6818), or if—when being financed—an obligation for continuing state disclosure is created (Sections 6876 and 6884).\n\nThe following discussion on capital outlay administration (Sections 6842–6869) deals with design-bid-build state construction projects —i.e., excludes leased facilities. Leasing alternatives are addressed in the capital asset planning and budgeting portion of the chapter (Sections 6810–6839) and as part of capital asset financing (Sections 6870– 6888)."

        "content": "The following summarizes statutory and administrative provisions relating to PWB.\n\nOrigin/Role : PWB was created by the Legislature in 1946 to offset any economic decline due to the cessation of a wartime economy, with two major areas of responsibility:\n\nApproving plans, allocating funds and determining the timing of major construction projects of state agencies after appropriations for such projects have been made by the Legislature; and Selection and acquisition of real property for location or expansion of state facilities and programs.\n\nOver the past 50 years, the role of PWB has changed to:\n\nProviding a review and approval process for adherence to the Legislature’s intent in its appropriation of funds for capital outlay projects; Carrying out various statutory control provisions relating to capital outlay projects; Selecting and acquiring real property for location or expansion of state facilities; Approving sales of surplus property pursuant to annual statutes authorizing the disposal of surplus real property; and Acquiring property and constructing facilities from the proceeds of revenue bonds (also called lease-revenue bonds ) issued by the board.\n\nMembership : Voting members are the:\n\nDirector of Finance, who historically has chaired PWB; Director of Transportation; Director of General Services; State Controller (for revenue bond matters only); and State Treasurer (for revenue bond matters only).\n\nIn addition, PWB has the following advisory members: The Director of the Employment Development Department when PWB is engaged in contingency planning for emergency public works per Government Code Section 15799.2; and non-voting legislative advisors (three Senators appointed by the Senate Rules Committee and three Assembly members appointed by the Speaker).\n\nPWB staff : The DOF Capital Outlay unit administers the functions of PWB and provides whatever assistance the board may require. DGS provides staff support for real property acquisitions and sales, and for energy assessment programs.\n\nMeetings : The PWB process, including monthly meetings, is described in Section 6844.\n\nCertifications/notifications to the Legislature that the project is within scope and cost : Prior to board action on any capital outlay appropriation, DOF certifies in writing to the Chairperson of the JLBC, the chairpersons of the respective fiscal committees, and the legislative members of PWB whether the requested action is in accordance with scope and cost as approved by the Legislature. If DOF approves changes to the legislatively approved scope or cost, or both, it must detail the changes and associated cost implications. Such reports also include all proposed or potential augmentations, as well as anticipated recognized deficits in excess of ten percent of the amount appropriated for the capital outlay projects. See additional procedures for certifications/notifications in Sections 6844, 6861, and 6863 of this chapter.\n\nApproval of preliminary plans : Per Government Code Section 13332.11 , funds appropriated for capital outlay may not be expended by any state department until DOF and PWB have approved preliminary plans for the project. PWB’s approval of preliminary plans ensures that a project proceeding into the working drawing and construction phases is consistent with legislatively approved cost and scope. This requirement does not apply to the Department of Transportation, to higher education segments’ non-state funded capital outlay, to the California Exposition and State Fair, or to any project specifically exempted from Section 13332.11 . In addition, this provision does not apply to acquisitions, equipment, minor projects, or amounts appropriated specifically for preliminary surveys, studies, or program planning. Finally, PWB processes in general do not apply to the State Water Project.\n\nProject augmentation: Sections 16352 , 16352.5 , 16354 , and 16409 of the Government Code make appropriations and authorize PWB to approve allocations of additional funds to augment construction and acquisition appropriations when projects cannot be undertaken because the cost exceeds the funds available for the projects.\n\nPWB’s authority to augment projects is limited to the following by Government Code Section 13332.11 :\n\nPWB must defer any augmentation in excess of 20 percent of the amount appropriated for a capital outlay project until the Legislature makes additional funds available for the specific project; Augmentations in excess of 10 percent (but no greater than 20 percent) of the amount appropriated for each capital outlay project must be reported to the Chairperson of the JLBC, or his or her designees, 20 days prior to PWB approval. PWB must defer approval of preliminary plans or any portion of an acquisition project if the estimated cost of the total project exceeds 20 percent of the amount appropriated, unless in the case of an acquisition project the board determines that a lesser portion of the property is sufficient to meet the objectives of the project approved by the Legislature.\n\nBy resolution, PWB has authorized the Director of Finance to augment projects within the following limits:\n\n10 percent of the total of the official estimate for that portion of the work, including related overhead and contingency expenses for such portion, or $50,000 whichever is the lesser; or The anticipated deficit previously recognized by the board; or $1,000 or less.\n\nSee Section 6861 for further discussion of PWB practices in interpreting Government Code Section 13332.11 .\n\nProperty acquisition law : The Legislature enacted the property acquisition in 1944, which is now set forth in Government Code Sections 15850–15866 . Principal provisions include:\n\nPWB selects and acquires real property for state departments when funds are appropriated by the Legislature, except for acquisitions for the following entities: Department of Water Resources; the State Reclamation Board; the Wildlife Conservation Board; the Department of Transportation; the Public Employees Retirement System; the Department of Fish and Game; the State Teachers’ Retirement System; the Department of Housing and Community Development; and the State Lands Commission.In addition, PWB approval processes for real property transactions do not apply to projects for the University of California and the California State University which are not funded through state appropriations. (Limited exemptions for the state conservancies have been authorized in statute.) All proposed acquisitions are brought to PWB for site selection and acquisition by negotiation or, if unable to purchase by negotiation, by filing an eminent domain action (Government Code Section 15853 ). Sites for lands acquired on behalf of the State Park System are selected by the Director of Parks and Recreation (Section 5006 , Public Resources Code). Government Code Section 15853 also requires PWB to make reports on the status and timing of park acquisitions to the Legislature.The essential feature is: For any park acquisition not completed through negotiations and/or condemnation, or abandoned by the Department of Parks and Recreation within six months of commencement of purchase negotiations, notice is given to appropriate fiscal committees and legislative members whose districts are affected; and Six months after the notice set forth in the preceding text, the same legislators are given the status of the projects, if parcels have been abandoned or not acquired. DGS prepares this report for PWB. PWB may acquire any interest in real property it deems advisable. PWB may purchase furnishings contained with any acquired improvement if the owner agrees to sell. PWB has eminent domain (condemnation) authority as described in Section 6866. Pursuant to Government Code Section 15855 (b), the board is the only state agency that may exercise this authority, with the exception of the following entities: The Department of Transportation , The Department of Water Resources , The State Lands Commission , The State Reclamation Board, The Department of Fish and Game , Hastings College of the Law , and The University of California .\n\nCurrent law and procedure require that certain ―evidences‖ (discussed in Section 6849) must be provided before an acquisition is submitted for board consideration. Until the property acquired is actually needed, jurisdiction lies with DGS (Government Code Section 15862 ).\n\nAs staff to PWB on acquisition matters, DGS obtains the information needed to assure PWB that:\n\nThe location of the proposed site meets the requirements of the department for which it is being acquired; The site is suitable for the project’s purpose and will not result in increased project costs; The site can be acquired within the funds available and is in accordance with the intent of the Legislature; and The price paid for the property is fully supported by an appraisal.\n\nSale of surplus property : DGS sponsors an annual bill to authorize disposition of excess state-owned real property (Government Code Section 11011 ). The legislation typically provides that PWB approves final disposition. However, DGS does not handle the sale of property for the Department of Transportation and the Department of Water Resources, or for properties of the University of California, the California State University or the California Community Colleges acquired through non-state funds.\n\nPWB lease-revenue bonds : PWB is authorized to issue revenue bonds (commonly referred to as lease-revenue bonds). The board administers four lease-revenue programs: public building construction, new prison construction, high technology educational and research facilities in public universities, and energy conservation. For additional information on these programs, see Section 6873.\n\nContingency plan for emergency public works: If conditions warrant, PWB may develop a contingency plan for emergency public works pursuant to Sections 15799.2 and 15799.4 of the Government Code. The plan consists of capital outlay or maintenance projects that have not been included in the Governor's Budget or otherwise presented for legislative review but which PWB believes would serve a useful public purpose if implemented. PWB then submits the plan to the Governor for incorporation into the annual economic report to the Legislature required by Section 15901 of the Government Code.\n\nPublic land trusts : Section 831.5 of the Government Code allows non-profit public land trusts to enter into agreements with the state to preserve open space and allow public access to natural resources and, in return, receive certain immunities from liability for injuries caused by natural conditions of unimproved property. The State Coastal Conservancy can enter into such agreements for projects in the Coastal Zone, and the Tahoe Conservancy can enter into agreements in the Tahoe Basin. PWB is responsible for agreements in the rest of the state.\n\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation concessions agreements : Public Resources Code Section 5080.20 requires PWB to approve any proposed concessions agreements with a total investment or estimated annual gross sales in excess of $500,000, which has not been approved by the Legislature in the Budget Act. The agreement may not be advertised for bid, negotiated, or amended in any way until PWB has notified the Legislature that:\n\nThe proposed concession agreement could not have been presented to the Legislature for review and approval or that it is necessary to revise the terms after legislative approval; and It would be adverse to the interests of the public to defer the review and approval to the time the Legislature next considers a budget bill.\n\nPWB may approve the proposed concession after giving at least 20 days’ written notice to the JLBC and the appropriate fiscal and policy committees.\n\nLong-lead capital outlay equipment : Pursuant to Government Code Section 15792 , PWB approval is required for state departments to incur obligations, to be met during the fiscal year following the year of project completion, for the purchase of equipment related to capital outlay projects for which the Legislature has approved construction funds. See also Section 6855, “long-lead equipment.”\n\nQuarterly reports: Client departments must submit quarterly reports to PWB on each project’s progress with respect to schedule, scope, and actual and projected expenditures (Section 6864)."

        "title": "LEASE -REVENUE BONDS",
        "content": "(Revised and Renumbered from 6872.) Lease-revenue bonds are used in the state’s capital outlay program to finance projects, and are generally, issued by the State Public Works Board (PWB). The revenue securing the debt service on the bonds comes from lease payments made by the occupying department. PWB issues bonds, and retains jurisdiction to the facility until the debt is retired. PWB’s lease-revenue program is described in Section 6843 Pursuant to the California Constitution, public agencies cannot enter into an indebtedness or liability without voter approval. However, under the Offner-Dean lease exception rule, long-term lease-revenue bonds entered into by public agencies are not considered an indebtedness or liability under the debt limit if the lease meets certain criteria. Nonetheless, bond rating agencies include lease-revenue payment obligations when calculating the state’s bonded indebtedness. Thus, there is a distinction between the concept of California constitutional debt and debt as defined by the municipal bond market . Key highlights : In contrast to GO bonds, annual appropriations are necessary for rental payments that support lease-revenue debt service. However, the obligation to pay is not extinguished if appropriations are not provided. Government Code Section 15848 provides for debt service payment in the event of no budget and in certain situations when there is a budget that failed to include an appropriation for debt service In contrast to GO bonds, annual appropriations are necessary for rental payments that support lease-revenue debt service. However, the obligation to pay is not extinguished if appropriations are not provided. Government Code Section 15848 provides for debt service payment in the event of no budget and in certain situations when there is a budget that failed to include an appropriation for debt service Generally, lease-revenue bonds pay interest at tax-exempt rates, which are slightly higher than tax-exempt rates for GO bonds. Lease-revenue payments are due if there is “beneficial use and occupancy” of the facility. If all or part of the facility cannot be occupied, the rent will be abated proportionate to that part of the facility that is unavailable. The term of the bonds cannot exceed the useful life of the facility. Lease-revenue projects typically require interim financing for costs incurred before the bonds are issued. INTERIM FINANCING The purpose of interim financing is to meet project cash flow needs for expenses incurred after project authorization, but prior to the issuance of long-term debt instruments. Interim financing for lease-revenue bonds may be necessary for preconstruction costs (preliminary plans and working drawings) as well as a portion or all of construction costs. PWB lease-revenue bonds are typically sold upon project completion, at which point any costs related to interim financing are repaid. Interim financing may be funded through a General Fund loan, pursuant to Section 15849.1 of the Government Code, or a Pooled Money Investment Account loan pursuant to Government Code Section 16312 . The Board determines the appropriate funding mechanism. PWB agenda package for interim financing: When submitting requests for of interim financing, the department provides the following: All information requested in Section 6822, such as the standard fiscal reporting requirements, and the agenda package. Project Delivery Agreement, with department signature. Evidence of CEQA compliance (Section 6826) such as a copy of the filed Negative Declaration or a link to the project within the state clearinghouse at https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov . A Summary of Conditions Letter or other document demonstrating the completion of Real Estate Due Diligence (Section 6827). Departments should contact their Capital Outlay Finance Budget Analyst for additional information related to PWB agenda packages for interim financing, e.g., the interim financing loan application and cashflow statement. THE BOND SALE The bond sale process begins months in advance of the actual sales, which occur twice a year; in the spring and in the fall. Lease-revenue bonds may be issued to finance projects or to refund previously issued bonds at more favorable interest rates. Lease-revenue bond sales are structured as competitive or negotiated, at the discretion of PWB and STO (see the pricing section below for more information). The information below provides an overview of the bond sale process. Agent For Sale: Pursuant to Government Code Section 5702 , the State Treasurer’s Office (STO) is the agent for sale for all bonds or evidences of indebtedness issued by the state, unless statute specifies otherwise. Bond sales calendar/timing restrictions: STO prepares a sales calendar for when bond sales occur. STO sets sales dates at its discretion, considering overall program priorities for access to the municipal bond market. Bond sales usually require a minimum of eight weeks of preparation before pricing is conducted. Closing (which is when funds become available) is typically one to two weeks following pricing. No sales using state General Fund disclosure (Appendix A of the Official Statement) are conducted during the “blackout periods”—which are generally: 1) the beginning of December to the release of the Governor’s Budget, 2) the beginning of May to the release of the May Revision, and 3) the beginning of July through final budget enactment (if the budget is not enacted by June 30). Appointment of members to the financing team; kickoff meeting : For lease-revenue bond sales, the PWB retains bond counsel and disclosure counsel and STO appoints financial advisors. For negotiated sales, STO will also appoint senior managers and underwriters. These parties, PWB, the departments, STO, Finance and other state agencies (and DGS for projects it manages) convene at a kickoff meeting to formally initiate the sale and to establish a financing schedule (often referred to as the “time and responsibilities schedule” or “T&R”) for the sale. Document review : Bond sales involve the preparation of a number of documents. PWB, STO, Finance, SCO, the Attorney General’s Office, and the financing team jointly review bond sale documents, including Appendix A, ensuring that the documents are properly drawn and that disclosure requirements are fully met. Due diligence review: Due diligence is the inquiry made to disclose all facts about PWB, the departments, the bond issuance, and the security for the issuance that would be material to a prospective bondholder. In lease-revenue and financing lease transactions, the department has an obligation to participate in the due diligence process and to disclose all material facts relating to the transaction. Structuring the issuance: The structure of an issuance refers to the amount and timing of principal repayments (maturities) and interest payments. STO, with the guidance of a Financial Advisor, determines the structure at the time of the bond sale based on a number of factors, including market conditions. Lease-revenue repayment schedules may extend to 35 years but are also usually only 15 to 25 years in length. STO solicits information from departments and PWB (or Finance) to assist in structuring lease-revenue issuances. Obtaining the bond rating : The state generally sells only investment-grade municipal securities. An investment rating is secured prior to the bond sale from one or more independent third parties, called rating agencies. Generally, an investment rating is associated with lower interest rates by giving investors additional comfort and increasing the universe of buyers. Ratings are based on an analysis of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various factors potentially affecting the likelihood of debt repayment for the specific obligation. (The ratings applies only to that obligation.) Investment ratings are typically obtained from three rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Investor Services. Pricing: Lease-revenue bonds are sold either on a competitive basis (i.e. low bid establishes price) or a negotiated basis (i.e. STO negotiates interest rates and any discounts with the market). PWB delegates pricing to STO, which generally occurs a week after the release of the POS. Bond closing : Moneys are not exchanged in a bond sale—and interest rates are not effective—until the bond sale closes, typically one to two weeks after pricing. The department (in the case of lease-revenue bonds) and issuer must review and sign all pre-closing documents prior to closing to ensure a smooth conclusion to the sale. Net proceeds are normally transferred by the underwriter to the State Treasury by wire in immediately available funds. Continuing disclosure and post-issuance compliance: During the life of the bonds, all departments are obligated to notify PWB of certain specified information which may be material to investment decisions on the securities. This is a major responsibility for issuers and departments, with serious legal ramifications for failure to perform. Continuing disclosure is made through annual reports and notices of certain events. Material misstatements or omissions in the annual reports or event notices may be the basis for claims of securities fraud under federal or state securities laws, actionable by the SEC or private plaintiffs, with substantial potential liability for issuers or other obligated persons. Mandatory post-issuance compliance training is provided to departments and tenant departments annually by PWB and bond counsel. All departments are obligated to seek PWB consent for arrangements affecting the use of the facility and for encumbrances on the facility. Departments are also obligated to retain all project documents for the life of the bonds plus three years. Brief definitions of key documents are provided in the following text: Authorizing resolution : The resolution authorizes the issuance of bonds and the execution of major legal documents, which is executed by PWB. Indenture : The indenture pledges certain revenues and other property as security for the repayment of the bonds, sets forth the terms of the bonds, contains the responsibilities and duties of the trustee, and the rights of the bondholders. The indenture contains a form of the bond that will be issued. A supplemental indenture is an indenture that amends or supplements a prior indenture. The indenture is executed by PWB and STO. Official statement (including preliminary official statement) : Provides all information that would be “material” to a prospective purchaser of the bonds, including descriptions of the issuer, terms of the bonds, security for the bonds, major legal documents, risk factors and tax matters, and financial statements. The preliminary official statement is a version used by the issuer or underwriters to inform the marketplace of the terms of the bonds being issued prior to receipt of bids at a competitive sale or prior to the determination of interest rates and purchase price in a negotiated sale. The official statement is of particular interest to the departments administering lease-revenue bond programs because it contains departmental disclosure requirements and project descriptions, as well as debt service requirements and the cost of issuance Bond purchase agreement : In a negotiated sale, an agreement is made between PWB and STO and an underwriter or group of underwriters (i.e. a syndicate) who have agreed to purchase the bond issue. The agreement sets forth the purchase price, interest rates and other terms of the bonds (often by reference to the official statement), date and time of closing, representations and warranties of the issuer, conditions to underwriters’ payment for bonds, and underwriter duties. In a competitive sale, the notice of sale serves the same function, specifying the factors used to determine the winning bid; the notice, the underwriter’s bid, and the issuer’s acceptance of the bid together constitute a bond purchase agreement. Continuing disclosure agreement : This agreement defines procedures for continuing disclosure, the contents of the annual report, and specific events to be disclosed. Parties to the document may include PWB, STO, the department, and bond holders as third-party beneficiaries Tax certificate and certificates to the tax certificate : The tax certificate is signed by the issuer and sets forth the facts and covenants necessary for the tax-exempt treatment of interest on the bonds. Obligated parties provide the issuer certificates upon which the PWB relies for the tax certificate. Lease Agreements : Lease-revenue financings are based on a series of leases, with the rental payments under one of the leases securing the debt service of the financings. The following describes the lease structure utilized for PWB lease-revenue bonds, but they can apply to other lease-revenue financings. The leases require careful review by the department because they outline departmental obligations to PWB. Site lease : The department leases the site on which the project will be constructed to PWB for the term of the bonds. PWB agrees to use the site solely for the purpose of constructing the project. It then leases the facility and site back to the department (see following facility lease).The site lease terminates upon retirement of the bonds. Facility lease : PWB leases the facility, defined as the project and the site, to the department including, without limitation, the terms and conditions of the site lease. The department covenants to use the facility during the term of the lease solely for public purposes and to take no actions related to the facility that would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the bonds. The facility lease terminates upon retirement of the bonds. The rental amount is equal to the annual principal and interest on the bond debt, plus any additional rental amounts ordered by PWB (such as trustee fees, accounting fees, PWB costs, etc.).The lease includes a requirement for the department to maintain replacement insurance for loss, damage, and earthquake (the latter only if available at a reasonable cost), liability insurance, and rental interruption insurance (normally to cover an interruption of up to two years). Closing documents : Numerous documents must be executed prior to closing in order to complete the bond transaction, including but not limited to, closing certificates and legal opinions."

        "title": "STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIRED WHEN REQUESTING PWB OR DOF ACTION",
        "content": "PWB and DOF information needs related to capital outlay projects are very similar. Both require an action request called the DF-14D, Request for Approval to Proceed or Encumber Funds , as well as standardized project cost and history information. This chapter refers to that common block of information as ―standard fiscal reporting requirements. ‖ In addition, PWB requires an agenda package made up of a specifically- formatted agenda item, a briefing document, and additional information depending upon the type of proposed board item.\n\nThis section describes the standard reporting requirements used by both PWB and DOF, and the PWB agenda package.\n\nStandard fiscal reporting requirements: When submitting a request for an action or approval by either PWB or DOF, the department must provide completed versions of the following standard reporting forms. (Only one set of standard reporting forms is required if submitting a request for multiple actions on the same project.)\n\nDF-14D, Request for Approval to Proceed or Encumber Funds: The DF-14D, shown in 6845 Illustration 1 of this section, is the official request document which identifies the project and the requested action, and serves as the official, signed certification by the department related to scope, cost and CEQA compliance. For projects managed by DGS, the “Project Manager” signature is the DGS project manager, otherwise it is the department’s project manager. The “Department Directoror Designee” signature is the department requesting the action (submitting the DF 14D). DOF’s signature on the returned DF-14D is evidence of PWB/DOF approval of the request. Any conditions of approval will be noted on the document. Project Cost, Funding and Schedule Summary: This summary, shown in 6845 Illustration 2 of this section, is a chronological history of costs, funding and schedules. Each submittal requires a new column with the most recent totals and dates. The cost summary is provided in the same manner as in the project’s COBCP. A section is provided to detail construction costs. The funding data includes all approved appropriations and executive orders, changes included in this request, and future funding requirements.“Total funding” must equal “total costs.”The schedule reflects the same events as those in the initial budget package. The first column must reflect the project as initially approved. Additional columns reflect the project at the time of the submittal of the requested action. Project Cost Detail Worksheet: The department must provide cost information in sufficient detail to communicate and support the request. The level of detail should be consistent with the budget package detail displayed in 6828 Illustration 2. The total costs must tie to the Project Cost, Funding and Schedule Summary, 6845 Illustration 2.\n\nPWB agenda package:\n\nWho submits an agenda package: The project manager—either DGS or the client department if it is authorized to act as project manager—submits the agenda item. However, if DGS submits the agenda item, the client department is nonetheless responsible for the accuracy of program information and for providing all required supporting documents to DGS in a timely manner. What comprises the agenda package: An agenda item, which is the legal action the client department is asking the board to take. A briefing document, which is used as part of the staff analysis for the board agenda. Briefing documents must include all the information described in the following text and in general should fit on one page. All pertinent backup material . Different types of agenda items have different information requirements. See the various sections on site selection and acquisition, preliminary plans, construction, bond items, augmentations, and project scope. A draft 20-day notification letter for items which must be noticed to the Legislature (scope changes and certain augmentations). See Section 6861 for augmentations and Section 6863 for scope changes. Examples of notification letters to the Legislature are available from the DOF Capital Outlay Unit. Format for agenda items: Departments must use a specific format for each type of agenda item. Because there are a number of possible board actions, formats are not included in this chapter. Obtain format guidelines from the DOF Capital Outlay unit and use only those guidelines when preparing agenda items for PWB action. How to submit agenda packages: For all agenda items and briefing documents, provide both an electronic copy on disk as well as a hard copy. The rest of the agenda package is submitted only in hard copy. When to submit agenda packages : See “key monthly time-frames” in Section 6844.\n\nBriefing document for agenda packages: As noted in the preceding text, a board briefing document must accompany each agenda package requesting a board action. This information is used in the staff analysis for the board meeting. Present information in the following format:\n\nProject title, matching agenda item. Project authority (all phases). Purpose of project and nature of proposed action: For preliminary plan approvals: Square footage by program use, and Number and type of buildings and landscaping etc. For site selection approvals: Estimated dollar amount, Acreage, and Ultimate purpose. For reversions, the reason for the reversion and the fund source reverted monies will be returned to (Section 6862 describes types of reversions). Statement of scope and cost: Identify any legislatively-imposed restrictions on the project; If the project is within scope and cost, a statement of consistency is adequate; If the scope has changed, provide a brief description of change, its necessity and the date that the request for JLBC notification was submitted; If the cost has changed, cite the dollar amount of the change. For increases, also provide the percentage of increase based on the legislatively approved cost for that phase. (Section 6861 provides instructions for computing augmentations.) If the increase exceeds 10 percent, provide the date that the request for JLBC notification was submitted to DOF; and Identify any previously approved augmentations and the total cumulative costs in both dollars and percentages. Depending upon the type of item, certify that funds are available. If the fund is managed by another department, provide a certification from that department that funds are available. If the appropriation is not project-specific, the department should declare that use of these funds for this project is consistent with the department’s expenditure plan for the appropriation. Fund certification is not required for funds managed by DOF (e.g., the General Fund, Public Resources Account, etc.). For construction projects, departmental certification per Section 6850 that CEQA requirements have been met. For site selections and acquisitions, departmental certification per Section 6849 that: CEQA has been complied with, including date final review period will be completed . (Provide a copy of the dated State Clearinghouse document.) Implied dedication has been considered in the property value. If necessary, a relocation study has been prepared and adequate funds are available for relocation costs. Project identification code (Section 6839). Summary of the construction/implementation schedule. Identify and discuss any other risks, concerns, controversy or other information that the board may need to make a fully informed decision.\n\nExamples of briefing documents are available from the DOF Capital Outlay unit.\n\n6845 Illustration 1\n\nREQUEST FOR APPROVAL TO PROCEED OR ENCUMBER FUNDS\n\nThe Department of ____________________ hereby requests PWB / DOF action related to the following project:\n\n1.

        "content": "No Public Works Board (PWB) action is required to start projects. However, Finance or the Department of General Services (DGS) must authorize release of funds and give approval to proceed, depending upon the phase of the project and the task. Unless the project involves an acquisition, the first (and frequently only) PWB approval normally occurs at the preliminary planning stage.\n\nOnce the Legislature authorizes funding for DGS-managed minor projects, studies, site acquisition, or preliminary plans in the Budget Act or separate statute, DGS initiates a Form 22 (or for bond funds a Form 220) requesting that funding for this phase be transferred to the Architectural Revolving Fund. The DGS forwards the form to the department for approval, which then submits it to Finance for approval. See DGS State Forms Directory for samples of the fund transfer forms. The form is then forwarded to the State Controller’s Office.\n\nReminder to departments on “project” per State Contract Act : Before beginning a project, departments are reminded to verify whether the project is governed by the State Contract Act. Section 10105 of the Public Contract Code sets a specific dollar threshold for projects, beyond which the act has governance. That dollar threshold is updated every two years by Finance in a Budget Letter."

        "title": "SITE SELECTION AND ACQUISITION",
        "content": "PWB’s role : Using DGS as its agent, PWB selects and acquires real property for most departments when the appropriation is subject to the Property Acquisition Law (Government Code Sections 15850–15866 ). Exceptions are listed in Section 6842. Even if a specific site is designated for acquisition by the Legislature, PWB must approve the site before any purchasing activities can begin, including negotiating with the prospective seller. DGS prepares all land acquisition and related agenda items for consideration and approval by the PWB.\n\nOverview of site selection and acquisition : The phase has two major steps:\n\nSite selection, CEQA compliance, and PWB approval of the chosen site with authorization to proceed to purchase; and Site purchase with subsequent PWB approval of the settlement price only if it exceeds the previously reported appraisal price.\n\nThis phase starts when the client department makes a written request to DGS to prepare a formal appraisal for the approved project. The request must be made by a department manager authorized to commit project funds and must give the Budget Act appropriation citation or statutory authority.\n\nAfter the appraisal, but before beginning any formal acquisition activities, DGS obtains PWB approval for a specific site consistent with the requirements of the Budget Act or enabling statute. (Where a specific site is not designated in the appropriation, DGS first assists the department in selecting a site).\n\nAfter PWB approves the site, DGS negotiates a settlement with the owner. If the settlement price exceeds the appraised value DGS reported to PWB at the time acquisition was authorized, DGS returns to the board for approval of the higher settlement price (and may, as necessary, request augmentation). Typically, the property acquisition phase must be completed before DOF releases design and construction funds to improve the site. Site selection and acquisition costs include:\n\nInvestigations, Surveys, Title costs, Appraisal fees, Staff time, and Relocation assistance (depending upon DOF’s assessment of need; requires specific justification).\n\nEvidence required by PWB: Current law requires that before a project is submitted to PWB for concurrence on site selection, there must be evidence that:\n\nImplied dedication has been considered in the appraised value. Implied dedication refers to a public easement which has been created through a history of use. (Determination of implied dedication is case-specific and based on facts involved in a given situation.) Implied dedications may reduce the value of a property. The project has complied with CEQA, as described in Section 6850. If improved property is to be acquired, a relocation study has been prepared and adequate funds are available for relocation costs. A legal description and title report covering each parcel to be selected has been completed. Notice has been given of the time and place of the PWB meeting and an agenda has been mailed to interested parties.\n\nTypes of board action to acquire property: There are three types of board actions associated with this phase (not including any possible augmentations or scope changes):\n\nApproval of site selection and authorization of acquisition; Possibly approval for acquiring less property than originally contemplated; Submit this item only if the project is solely an acquisition project, the reduction in property exceeds 20 percent of the legislatively-approved acquisition value, and the client department believes that a lesser portion of the property is sufficient to meet the objectives of the project approved by the Legislature (see Section 13332.11 [g] of the Government Code); Legislative notification is required; therefore, the item must be submitted 30 working days in advance of the proposed PWB meeting date. Possibly approval of the settlement price, but only if it exceeds the appraisal price previously reported at the time PWB authorized the acquisition.\n\nIn all cases, DGS is responsible for submitting the agenda package to DOF for those departments which must acquire property through PWB (for exempt departments, see Section 6842). However, client departments are responsible for meeting DGS’ information needs to prepare the agenda packages.\n\nAgenda information :\n\nSite selection and acquisition. The following information is required: All elements specified in Section 6845 for both the agenda package and standard fiscal reporting requirements; CEQA documents per Section 6850. Acquiring less property pursuant to Government Code Section 13332.11 (g). The agenda package includes: All the elements specified in Section 6845 for both the agenda package and standard reporting requirements. However, if this request is made at the same time as the board item for site selection and acquisition, it is handled as a sub- item and uses the agenda package and standard reporting requirements for the main item; A written statement explaining why the purchase of lesser property fulfills the Legislature’s intent; and A draft notification letter to the Legislature. A settlement price which exceeds the appraisal. The agenda package includes: All elements specified in Section 6845 for both the agenda package and standard reporting requirements. However, if this request is made at the same time as the board item for site selection and acquisition, it is handled as a sub-item and uses the agenda package and standard reporting requirements for the main item; An explanation for the increase in the settlement price; If an augmentation is required, a separate agenda package is not needed but the submittal must include the additional information outlined in Section 6861.\n\nInterim property management by DGS after acquisition: Until property acquired under the Property Acquisition Law is needed, jurisdiction lies with DGS:\n\nThe Director of General Services may transfer jurisdiction to the client department if in his opinion early transfer is in the best interest of the state (e.g., the department requires interim use for parking); DGS may lease all or any part of the property; DGS may remove or demolish structures; DGS may sell or dispose of the improvements; and Rentals received are deposited in a special account in the General Fund and, when appropriated by the Legislature, are available to DGS to maintain, improve or care for the property until needed for the purpose acquired (Government Code Section 15863), with the exception of lands acquired for the State Park System (Public Resources Code 5003.17). However, proceeds of sale of improvements are not deposited in the special account or available for maintenance."

        "title": "ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REVIEW PROCESS",
        "content": "PWB requires satisfaction of environmental concerns in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) before it will approve preliminary plans for a project and generally prior to approval of site selection as well. Legal statutes and related regulations covering CEQA can be found in Public Resource Code Section 21000 et seq. and its accompanying regulations, California Code of Regulations (CCR) 15000 et seq. Many actions brought before PWB for consideration and approval are ―projects‖ within the definition of CEQA. These statutes and regulations set out the environmental review requirements for such projects. Key definitions: For assistance on understanding the documents and notices required by CEQA, see the Guidelines for California Environmental Quality Act , Section 15000–15387, CCR, Title 14, Chapter 3. The guidelines provide an explanation of the environmental process and the definition of many common terms. The following summarizes a few frequently used terms and describes what CEQA documents include: Project per CEQA: The term project per CEQA is defined in CCR Section 15378 (a) (3) as an activity involving a lease, permit, or license issued to a person or entity. Environmental impact report: An environmental impact report (EIR) is one of the three basic types of environmental documents that may be prepared by a lead agency to disclose the potential environmental consequences of an action. An EIR consists of draft and final documents. There are several types of EIR (focused, supplemental, program, etc.). An EIR ―…is an informational document which will inform public agency decision-makers and the public generally of the significant environmental effect of a project, identify possible ways to minimize significant effects, and describe reasonable alternatives to the project‖ (Section 15121, Title 13, Chapter 3 of the CCR). An EIR is required when a project will have one or more significant environmental effects that cannot be either avoided or reduced to a level of insignificance through the use of mitigation measures or changes to the project. Negative declaration/initial study: A second type of environmental document is a negative declaration. A negative declaration may be used if the project is not expected to have one or more significant effects on the environment. A negative declaration typically is supported by an initial study or initial study checklist. Categorical exemption : A categorical exemption is an exemption from CEQA based on one or more classes of actions/projects established in regulation. Each class of projects has been determined to not have a significant effect on the environment.\n\nRelated notices include: Notice of determination: A notice of determination is a brief notice filed by the lead or responsible agency after it approves or determines to carry out a project or action that was subject to CEQA. For state projects, the notice is filed with the State Clearinghouse, Office of Planning and Research. Filing of this notice starts a 30-day litigation period. See Sections 15075 and 15094 of CCR, Title 14, for the contents of this notice. A notice of determination is used for both EIRs and negative declarations. Notice of exemption : A notice of exemption is a brief notice that may be filed by the lead agency after it approves or determines to carry out a project or action that was exempt from CEQA because the project was ministerial, categorically exempt , etc. For state projects, the notice is filed with the State Clearinghouse.Filing of this notice starts a 35-day litigation period. Client department’s role : Environmental review is typically required for construction projects, projects funded through multi-year capital programs, land acquisitions, and land transfers. Other PWB actions may also be subject to the CEQA environmental review process. The lead agency in each case has the responsibility for determining whether the project is subject to CEQA. The client department is responsible for meeting the requirements of CEQA. Departments must certify to the PWB that CEQA requirements have been met, including successful completion of the litigation period on each respective project approval, and must provide corroborating evidence (such as a date-stamped notice of determination or categorical exemption). In addition, departments must notify DOF of any developments, subsequent to completion of CEQA, that may indicate environmental contamination or other environmental issues that may require additional activities and/or costs. Changes in the project: The client department as lead agency ensures that there have been no changes in the project, site conditions, or other factors that may make it necessary to prepare additional environmental documentation. The need for additional documentation could arise for a variety of reasons, especially if there has been a substantial period between completion of the environmental review process and project submittal to the board. For example, if information becomes available that there is an unexpected problem of soil contamination within the project site, the lead agency may need to revise the previously approved environmental document. Other examples include the adoption of new regulatory standards that impose constraints on the project, changes in the setting of the project site such as the reduced availability of on-site utilities (water supplies, sewer service, etc.), increased traffic congestion, or the development of adjacent land uses that conflict with the project.\n\nThe client department must also ensure that all projects remain in compliance with the environmental document prepared and adopted for each respective action. In some cases, it may be necessary to provide additional documentation to support the finding that the original environmental process remains valid. Both state and federal environmental review processes provide guidance on when supplemental or revised environmental documentation may be needed subsequent to the approval of a project.\n\nPWB practices : Because resolution of CEQA concerns should generally precede PWB’s approval of state funds for a project, PWB follows these practices:\n\nWhen processes should be completed : Departments must provide PWB with evidence that the state’s environmental review process has been completed by the lead agency (the public agency with primary authority for carrying out the action) prior to the required PWB action. For construction projects, this means prior to approval of preliminary plans; and For acquisition projects, this means prior to approval of site selection and acquisition. Notice of determination, categorical exemption: In most cases, completion involves filing of the applicable project approval notice by the lead agency—either a notice of determination or a categorical exemption , as required by state regulation. Litigation period : The litigation period (described in the preceding text) on the notice must have expired without a valid challenge before PWB will consider the item. The litigation period for a notice of determination is 30 calendar days; the litigation period for a categorical exemption is 35 calendar days. Consult the regulations for litigation periods for other types of notices.\n\nEvidence of the completion of this process assures the board that it has minimized risk in committing state funds to a particular project or undertaking.\n\nCEQA compliance outside the PWB process: CEQA requirements are not limited to projects reviewed by PWB. Actions not reviewed by PWB, such as minor capital outlay projects, may nonetheless constitute ―projects‖ within the definition of CEQA and its accompanying regulations. Again, in each case the lead agency is responsible for determining the application of CEQA to each project and fulfilling the relevant requirements.\n\nSections 6849 and 6851 describe how CEQA compliance should be presented in the PWB agenda package."

        "title": "PRELIMINARY PLANS REVIEW",
        "content": "What are preliminary plans? Preliminary plans are the initial design phase in preparing the construction bidding documents. The discussion in this section applies to the design- bid-build process used for most state projects (Section 6841). These documents are developed from the information contained in the budget package. Typically, the preliminary plans are developed in two distinct steps referred to as schematics and design development. The two-step process allows the department and architect/engineer to interact before the design is developed, helping to ensure a mutual understanding of the design objectives, limitations and budget.\n\nSchematic documents : Schematic documents are the initial architectural and engineering plans prepared during the preliminary plan phase, depicting the designer’s conceptual solution to project needs. The major difference compared with design documents is the amount of detail. Design documents : These are the final documents which result from the preliminary plan phase, defined by Section 3.00 of the Budget Act as a site plan, architectural floor plans, elevations and a cost estimate. For each utility, site development, conversion, and remodeling project, the drawings must be sufficiently descriptive to convey accurately the location, scope, cost, and the nature of the improvement being proposed. Beginning and end of phase : If a department contracts with DGS for project management, the preliminary plans phase starts with the request to DOF to release funds for preliminary plans funds using a Form 22 or a GS-OSA 220 for bond items (6868 Illustrations 1 and 2). Upon approval of the release of funds, the design/construction administrator has the design prepared either by state personnel or through contracts with private sector architects/engineers. This phase ends when PWB approves the preliminary plans. An overview of all capital outlay phases is provided in Section 6808. Client department’s role: The client department is responsible for obtaining PWB review and approval of preliminary plans prior to expenditure of appropriated funds for subsequent phases. When requesting approval of preliminary plans, the client department must either: Certify on the DF-14D that all present and future phases will be within scope and cost per supplemental budget language and legislatively-approved COBCPs; or Request adjustment through the appropriate change process (Section 6861 discusses cost increases; Section 6863 discusses scope changes). In addition, the client department must demonstrate that it has met environmental requirements for the project before PWB will approve preliminary plans (Section 6850). Departments are reminded not to start preliminary plans (or any other phase) with any funds other than the approved phase appropriation or in advance of DOF authorization of a DF-14D. PWB’s role/restrictions related to preliminary plan approval: Section 13332.11 (a) of the Government Code requires both DOF and PWB to approve all preliminary plans to ensure that projects proceeding to working drawings and construction are consistent with legislatively approved cost and scope. Section 13332.11 (g) requires the board to defer action with respect to approval of preliminary plans if the estimated cost of the project exceeds 20 percent of the amount appropriated. If construction has not yet been appropriated, there is no requirement under statute for the board to defer action on the preliminary plans. However, PWB will calculate the project’s estimated percentage increase based on the last legislatively recognized project cost. Depending upon the circumstances, it is generally board practice to defer action and notify the Legislature when such increases are estimated to exceed 20 percent.\n\nValue engineering may be required before PWB considers a request for a recognized deficit : If a project is expected to exceed cost based on the preliminary plans, PWB may require value engineering to determine cost savings strategies before it will recognize a potential deficit. The principal concepts which underlie the value engineering methodology are function, cost, and worth. The approach is to analyze the functional requirements of a project’s materials, methods, components and subsystems in order to explore alternate solutions which improve project efficiency without reducing program value. During this process, all expenditures relating to design, construction, maintenance, operation, replacement, etc., are considered. Mandatory review approvals : Various statutes require that certain elements of preliminary plans and working drawings be reviewed by oversight agencies before proceeding to bid. Examples of possible mandatory reviews at the preliminary plans stage include the State Fire Marshal, the California Coastal Commission, and the State Historic Preservation Officer. (Note: mandatory review approvals must be identified in the COBCP per Section 6818.) PWB agenda package for preliminary plans : When submitting requests for approval of preliminary plans, provide the following: All information requested in Section 6845, including both the standard fiscal reporting requirements and the agenda package; A completed, dated set of preliminary plans, outline specifications, and a cost estimate (note: all department-retained funds and federal or other non-state funds contributing to the total project costs must be accounted for); For proposed cost increases, the information required in Section 6861; For proposed scope changes, the information required in Section 6863; A \" Public Works Project Authorization and Transfer Request\" —Form 22 (6868 Illustration 1) for the working drawings phase. Projects financed from bond funds use a different transfer form (GS-OSA 220, 6868 Illustration 2); and Evidence of CEQA compliance per Section 6850, such as a copy of the filed Negative Declaration. Preliminary plans presentation meeting : Client departments must present their preliminary plans to PWB staff in a plans review meeting before PWB staff will consider a request for plans approval. This meeting must occur prior to the screening meeting for that month’s agenda. The purpose of the meeting is to verify that the project is within scope based on document review. After the board has approved preliminary plans : DOF will sign copies of the DF- 14D and Form 22 and return them to the client department for distribution to DGS and SCO. Time-frames for submitting requests for preliminary plans approval to board staff are presented in Section 6843. Approved preliminary plans become the final definition of project scope : For most projects, scope is initially defined in the COBCP and published in supplemental language to the Budget Act. The preliminary plans and specifications, as approved by the PWB, later become the final definition of the approved scope of the project. Scope changes to these documents must be specifically approved by DOF in writing before the department can make additional expenditures to revise the plans or to redesign the project, unless such changes are authorized in the Budget Act or other subsequent legislation (Government Code Section 13332.11 [b]). Scope changes are discussed in Section 6863."

        "title": "EQUIPMENT",
        "content": "Group 1 and 2 equipment : Capital outlay equipment is categorized either as Group 1 or Group 2 equipment: Group 1 equipment is installed equipment such as heating and air conditioning units and is budgeted as part of the construction phase. Group 2 equipment is movable equipment, such as tables and chairs (but not replacement equipment) and is budgeted as its own project phase, typically following construction. Not all equipment is classified as capital outlay : See Section 6806 for the difference between equipment budgeted through the support appropriation versus capital outlay equipment. How to request funds for capital outlay equipment : Specific information is required when requesting funding for capital outlay equipment. See Section 6818 for budgeting instructions. Expenditure of equipment funds requires DOF approval : Government Code Section 13332.11 (c) limits the cumulative expenditure of project funds for equipment to $2,000 without prior approval by DOF. This refers to the purchase of Group 2 equipment budgeted in the equipment phase of a project. The project manager requests approval by providing the standard fiscal reporting requirements specified in Section 6845. Long-lead equipment: Although final equipment lists are generally not approved for purchase until after PWB has approved preliminary plans, there are instances when equipment must be ordered in advance because of installation problems or extended manufacturing time. Subject to DOF and PWB approval, Government Code Section 15792 allows departments to incur equipment obligations to be paid during the fiscal year following the year of a project completion. This authorization: Is limited to the purchase of equipment related to capital outlay projects for which the Legislature has appropriated construction funds; Applies to both Groups 1 and 2 equipment, although in practice the request is made generally for the latter; and Is subject to the determination of future year equipment funding needs based on the project schedule.\n\nSee also Section 6842 on PWB’s role and responsibilities related to capital outlay equipment.\n\nAgenda package for approval of long-lead equipment.

        "content": "Project Occupancy : Finance must be notified by the department when the project is ready for occupancy (the date of final inspection, beneficial use or occupancy of the project, whichever is earliest). A copy of the Certificate of Occupancy must be sent to Finance. For lease--revenue funded projects, this is typically the date when insurance must be in place and triggers when lease payments begin. Information requirements related to notification of project occupancy : The standard fiscal reporting requirements described in Section 6845; and A copy of the “Certificate of Occupancy” Modifications after occupancy : If the department has determined that there are modifications necessary to complete the project after occupancy, and savings are available or an augmentation can be justified, the department may submit an item to the PWB for either a “cost increase within appropriation” or an augmentation (Section 6861). The PWB item should include a list of proposed modifications to be completed under the existing contract and, for each modification, a justification narrative including cost estimates and scheduled completion date. Project Completion: When the contract has been accepted and completed by both the contractor and DGS (or exempt department) and claims have been settled, the DGS (or exempt department) prepares a “Notice of Completion” pursuant to Section 3093 of the Civil Code. A copy of this notice is sent to Finance and for lease-revenue funded projects a copy is also sent to the STO. This notification must be prepared within 1 year of the date of occupancy as described in the preceding text. Extensions to the deadline (i.e. for scheduled completion of approved “modifications after occupancy”) must be approved by Finance. Information requirements related to notification of completion : The standard fiscal reporting requirements described in Section 6845; and A copy of the “Notice of Completion.”\n\nProject Close Out : “Project close out” reflects the closing of the financial records related to a project. Final project financial statements are reportable to Finance within three months of project completion unless an extension has been approved by Finance.\n\nReturn of Funds Transfer: Government Code, Section 14959 requires that DGS transfer the unencumbered project funds out of the Architectural Revolving Fund to the originating appropriation within three months of project completion. The department must submit a Return of Funds Transfer form (available from DGS) to effect that transfer. Financial statements: Departments shall provide final project financial statements to Finance . These statements should include an accountability for agency retained authority. Outstanding claims should be treated as encumbrances. Reversion of remaining project funds: Departments must submit an item to the PWB for reversion of any remaining project appropriation authority to the originating fund (Section 6862). Reversion items should include an accountability for agency retained authority. Outstanding claims should be treated as encumbrances."

        "title": "AUGMENTATIONS, ADDITIONAL COSTS (WITHIN APPROPRIATION) AND RECOGNITION\n        OF DEFICITS",
        "content": "PWB’s authority to augment : The PWB’s authority to augment capital outlay projects, and the appropriations for those augmentations, are set out in Government Code Sections 16352 , 16352.5 , 16354 , and 16409. Sections 13332.11 (for design-bid-build projects) and 13332.19 (for design-build projects) of the Government Code limits that authority as follows: Augmentations are limited to 20 percent of the amount appropriated; Any single augmentation or cumulative augmentation exceeding 10 percent of the funds appropriated requires a 20-day notification to JLBC prior to action by the PWB; PWB may recognize a potential augmentation of a future project phase, which the board terms a recognized anticipated deficit. In addition, by board policy and practice: Recognition of anticipated deficits is generally limited to the construction phase. Augmentations of less than 10 percent may be treated as a delegated item by PWB staff, and at their discretion may be approved prior to the PWB monthly meeting. In this case, the augmentation approval will be reported as a “reportable” at the PWB meeting. The balance of this section describes PWB procedures in implementing Section 13332.11 . A broad overview of PWB authority is provided in Section 6842. Compelling need: While PWB is authorized to augment capital outlay projects, augmentations are not approved unless there is a compelling need, and only after: Non-committed project funds (contingencies) have been considered as a possible source of funding; Cost reductions which do not affect scope are evaluated. PWB staff may request the client department to evaluate and include deductive alternates before proceeding to bid (see Section 6852); and For projects by the Department of Parks and Recreation, the California Science Center, and the various Conservancies under the Natural Resources Agency, the use of non- state funds is evaluated when potentially available. PWB authority to augment projects does not relieve departments of the responsibility to keep projects within approved cost and scope to the maximum extent possible. PWB will not use its augmentation authority to fund client revisions for non-essential items.\n\nHow to compute the augmentation: If an appropriation is for a single project phase—such as preliminary plans, working drawings or construction—the amount of the phase is used to calculate the allowable augmentation (i.e., no more than 20 percent). If the appropriation funds multiple phases, PWB staff has the option to use the total appropriation to determine the allowable augmentation. If a project has multiple funding appropriations, the total of the combined appropriations can be used as the baseline for augmentation, and PWB staff has the option to determine which funding source(s) and which appropriation(s) will be augmented. PWB agenda item requirements for augmentations, anticipated deficits, and cost increases within appropriation: A PWB agenda item is required for any augmentation or departmental request for PWB to recognize an anticipated deficit or cost increase within appropriation. If the request requires formal board action (i.e., not delegated to PWB staff), it must be submitted to Finance 20 working days preceding the PWB meeting. Those requests for augmentation and recognition of anticipated deficits which require legislative notification (i.e., those in excess of 10 percent) must be submitted to Finance 30 working days prior to the scheduled PWB meeting. Formats and examples for agenda items are available from the Finance Capital Outlay unit. Agenda packages for augmentations : Construction augmentations to award bid. Provide the following: All information requested in Section 6845, including the standard fiscal reporting requirements and the agenda package; A draft legislative notification if the augmentation exceeds 10 percent; A copy of the bid tabulation for construction augmentations (see the illustration in Section 6853); and A narrative description justifying the need for such augmentation. This must address efforts to include deductive alternates, value engineering, contingency reductions or scope modifications to address augmentations needs, and the consequences if the request is not approved. Construction augmentations during construction. Provide the following:\n\nAll information requested in Section 6845, including the standard fiscal reporting requirements and the agenda package; A draft legislative notification if the augmentation exceeds 10 percent; A complete narrative description justifying the need for such cost increases, including the following: Status of the project and percentage complete; Full description of the unanticipated items, their cost, why needed, and alternative solutions; Reason(s) why costs were not included in the original bidding documents and/or as deductive or additive alternatives to the bid, as appropriate; Reason(s) why deductive alternates cannot be change ordered to cover the additional costs; Reasons why these items cannot be funded within the construction contingency; Explanation of efforts to value engineer remaining project components; Consequences if not approved; and Whether the additional items are within the scope approved by the Legislature. 3. Agenda package for augmentations of land acquisition projects. Provide the following: All information requested in Section 6845, including the standard fiscal reporting requirements and the agenda package; A draft legislative notification if the augmentation exceeds 10 percent; A listing of all budgeted parcels and a description of the acquisition status of each parcel (acquired, in negotiation, etc.); A complete narrative description of alternative solutions, including why the augmentation is the correct solution, and consequences if not approved; and A parcel map showing the relationship of the parcels requiring augmentation to the total funded acquisitions.\n\nAgenda packages for recognized anticipated deficits: At the end of the preliminary plans, if the project is estimated to exceed its construction budget, the client department may request PWB to approve the preliminary plans and to recognize an anticipated deficit. PWB notifies the JLBC of the anticipated deficit if it exceeds 10 percent of the construction appropriation. In the absence of a construction appropriation, PWB generally interprets these limits and notification requirements based on the last legislatively recognized estimate for construction.\n\nWhen requesting a recognized deficit as part of preliminary plans approval, provide:\n\nA sub-item recognizing the anticipated deficit including a complete narrative description justifying the need for the cost increase in the briefing text as follows: A full description of the unanticipated items and estimated cost; The need for the items, the reasons why those items were not included in the original proposal, alternative solutions, and consequences if not approved; Discussion of alternatives such as value engineering, deductive alternates, or reworking the preliminary plans or working drawings; and Whether the additional items are within the scope approved by the Legislature (if not, a separate scope change item is required with the information specified in Section 6863). A draft legislative notification if the anticipated deficit exceeds 10 percent.\n\nAgenda packages for cost increases within appropriation: Occasionally a department may need PWB to approve additional project costs for items not anticipated in the bidding documents. If there are bid savings to cover the costs (i.e., revised project cost remains within the original appropriation), and the additional items are within approved scope, PWB may approve the increase without notifying the Legislature. (Otherwise, such a request must be for an augmentation and/or scope change). For cost increases within appropriation, provide the following information:\n\nAll information requested in Section 6845, including the standard fiscal reporting requirements and the agenda package; A complete narrative description justifying the need for such cost increases. At a minimum, include the following: Full description of the unanticipated items; Reasons why they were not included in the original bidding documents; Reasons why these items cannot be funded within the construction contingency; Consequences if not approved; and Whether the additional items are within the scope approved by the Legislature."

        "content": "What is scope? The scope of a project is what will be constructed (or acquired) and why . Thus, scope encompasses both the physical characteristics of the project and the intended program use. Scope is established initially in the COBCP, with key elements reiterated (or restricted) in supplemental language to the Budget Act. The preliminary plans, and later the working drawings for design-bid-build projects, and performance criteria for design- build projects—refine scope in terms of the physical characteristics of the project. The various information sources for a project’s scope are discussed in more detail in the following text.\n\nScope changes require Finance approval. Section 13332.11 (c) of the Government Code states that ”A substantial change shall not be made from the preliminary plans or working drawings without written approval by the Department of Finance”. This approval must be granted before the department can make any expenditures to redesign the project or to revise the plans, unless those revisions are authorized in the Budget Act or other subsequent legislation.\n\nSections 13332.11(h)(2) and 13332.19(g)(2) require Finance to report approved scope changes to the Legislature. In practice, this restriction and related notification requirement begins with project authorization , even before preliminary plans are considered by PWB.\n\nAfter Finance approves a scope change and the Legislature has been noticed, PWB “recognizes” the scope change in a board item, incorporating it into the board’s official record for the project. As appropriate, PWB may also require that a formal revision to the preliminary plans be submitted for approval.\n\nWhen is a proposed change substantial ? Finance determines whether a proposed change is substantial and therefore a scope change, based on a review of the facts on a case-by-case basis and in consideration of legislative intent. Therefore, it is not practical to publish absolute definitions for scope. However, administrative guidelines follow for determining which project changes should be discussed with Finance to assess their significance.\n\nGuidelines to determine which project changes are potentially substantial: The department is required to report to Finance any proposed project change as outlined in the following text. Finance will work with the department to assess whether the change is substantial . (The initial report can be made by phone or e-mail; Finance may require written follow-up for its records. For changes deemed to be scope adjustments, the client department must submit all information required at the end of this section.)\n\nA department must discuss the following with its Finance capital outlay analyst to determine whether a scope change would result:\n\nChanges to the approved program use , as defined by: Assigned program space for facilities. Any change which would add or lessen space for a new function, change capacity for a program activity, use space for a function or activity different than originally intended, or alter the ratios in multi- use space, is reportable to Finance for evaluation as a potential scope change; Land use purpose for acquisition projects; and Any other expectations or restrictions regarding program use set forth in the authorizing statute. In this context, program is defined at the activity level (i.e., a narrower definition of program than typically used in the Governor’s Budget or the Budget Act). Changes to the physical characteristics of the real asset as it relates to: Facility size, shape, major structural characteristics, and location. Size generally may be described in either gross square feet or assignable square feet. For some projects, such as sewer, electrical or HVAC, size may be a function of capacity. Shape is a function of both the footprint and elevation of a structure. Footprint includes the interior arrangement as well as the facility perimeter . Major structural characteristics will vary by project, but may include the structural system, architectural style, construction materials, and major mechanical, electrical or utility systems. Location may be as specific as parcel number, or more generally city, county or region, depending upon initial definition in the COBCP, statutory language, or supplemental language. Acreage size, land type, and location; and Any other expectations or restrictions regarding the physical characteristics of the real asset as set forth by authorizing statute.\n\nChanges which meet the reporting requirements to Finance, as described in the preceding text, are not necessarily scope changes unless Finance so determines. Reasonable judgment is required in contacting Finance; however, because the consequences of unapproved scope changes can be severe (including project termination), departments and project managers should err on the side of caution.\n\nGenerally, the following project changes are not reportable to Finance (as potential\n\nscope changes):\n\nCost , although the impact of a scope change on project and related operational costs must be carefully considered (cost changes may or may not result in scope changes; conversely, scope changes can occur with or without associated cost changes). See Section 6861 for instructions on approval processes for project cost changes. Changes to correct minor errors and omissions in the construction documents or to respond to minor unforeseen site conditions (i.e., substitution of fixtures when products are no longer manufactured, corrections required by code authorities, minor demolition of materials not foreseen during design, addition of electric services to motors, etc.). However, when such changes cannot reasonably be categorized as minor, or if they alter programmatic capability or requirements, the matter must be discussed with Finance to assess impact on project scope.\n\nConstruction contingency funds should be reserved for correcting problems in achieving approved scope and for essential scope changes. Construction contingency funds should be used to pay for the cost of resolving problems arising from design errors/oversights, unforeseen conditions, code requirements, and the cost (if any) for approved scope changes. Non-essential client change orders should be avoided. See Section 6854.\n\nSource references for project scope: As noted in the preceding text, a project’s scope is defined in several source documents.\n\nFor budget act projects, the COBCP : A detailed description of project scope is required in the COBCP (Section 6818). This description becomes one of the primary references for later interpretation of potential scope changes. For budget act projects, the supplemental language report of the Legislature : This language summarizes the COBCP for each specific project and outlines costs for studies, acquisition, preliminary plans, working drawings, construction and equipment using the California Construction Cost Index (CCCI) as published in Engineering News Record for the year of the original project appropriation. While a proposed schedule for the commencement and completion of various phases of each project is contained in the scope language, this project schedule is not considered part of the project scope for purposes of scope changes . For non-budget act projects, special legislation : For projects approved through special legislation, where preliminary program guides and budget packages are not available, the language in the legislation may provide initial definition of approved scope. Other documents used to support the need for the legislation, such as project descriptions, which may be included or supplemented in master plans, special reports, and costs estimates, may provide more detailed scope definition. Also, subsequent documents submitted to and approved by the Legislature (if applicable), further define legislatively approved scope. Preliminary plans and working drawings as approved by Finance and PWB. Once preliminary plans have been approved by the board, the specific plans and specifications become the final definition of the scope of the project, as it pertains to physical characteristics.\n\nAgenda packages for scope changes : Provide the following information:\n\nAll information requested in Section 6845, including the standard fiscal reporting requirements and the agenda package; and the following additional information: Any mandated reviews and approvals required related to the project change; Any required CEQA compliance related to the change; What design corrections were required, and why; What programmatic changes were required, why , and when those changes were approved by the Finance support analyst; and What the change’s savings or cost implications are, and why. If an augmentation is also required, a sub-item must be attached consistent with Section 6861 (and also noticed to the Legislature, if necessary)."

Long-term financing generally follows one of three paths:\n\nIf the project authority is a GO bond appropriation, the state issues GO bonds to finance the project. Debt service is paid through an appropriation in the applicable bond act from the General Fund. If the project authority is a lease-revenue appropriation, lease-revenue bonds are generally issued by the PWB. A separate lease rental payment item is included in the annual Budget Act under the department’s business unit.

        "content": "Definition: General Obligation (GO) bonds are a form of long-term borrowing in which the state issues municipal securities and pledges its full faith and credit to their repayment. Bonds are repaid over many years through semi-annual debt service payments. The California Constitution requires that GO bonds be approved by a majority vote of the public and sets repayment of GO debt before all other obligations of the state except those for the public school system and public institutions of higher education.\n\nKey statutory authorities : Article XVI, Section 1 of the California Constitution prohibits the Legislature from creating debt or liability exceeding $300,000 without a majority vote by the people, except in the case of war.\n\nGovernment Code, Title 2, Division 4, Part 3 (Section 16650 et seq.) sets out the statutory framework for GO bonds. Statutory authorization for individual GO bond measures is placed programmatically in the codes (e.g., water authorizations are located in the Water Code).\n\nKey highlights :\n\nGO bond debt is a major component of the overall bond debt burden of the state. The most commonly used measure of debt is annual debt service as a percentage of General Fund revenues. There is no California statutory or constitutional limit on the absolute level (or anyother measurement) of state debt, other than that specified in Article XVI. GO debt repayment is continuously appropriated and therefore not included as a separate appropriation in the annual Budget Act. Debt service consists of both principal and interest payments. GO debt repayment structure is determined by the State Treasurer’s Office (STO) at the time bonds are sold based on a variety of factors including the taxable status of the bonds and bond market conditions, among others. The California Constitution authorizes GO bonds with up to 50-year maturities, but federal tax requirements and market practice usually dictate that bonds be issued no longer than 30 years. In addition, certain bond acts may further limit maturities. GO bond Finance committees, created in respective bond acts, must authorize the sale of new money and refunding bonds, as well as the use of interim financing as authorized in law (See Section 6878). Finance surveys departments semiannually to determine their projected cash flow needs for GO bond-funded programs. The STO is the agent for sale and trustee for state GO bonds."

        "title": "STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD (PWB) LEASE-REVENUE BOND PROGRAMS",
        "content": "The PWB is authorized to issue lease-revenue bonds to finance acquisition and construction projects when such projects are authorized by the Legislature. In a typical project, the department leases the site for a nominal fee to the PWB, although for some projects the PWB may acquire the site directly. The department then constructs the project as PWB’s agent. The PWB leases the completed facility back to the department for a rental fee equal to the amount needed to provide for the debt service on the revenue bonds and associated administrative expenses. Leases can be for periods up to 35 years, although 15 to 25 years is typical. The lease term cannot exceed the useful life of the capital asset. The proceeds of lease revenue bonds need to be expended in certain time frames under federal tax law. Until spent, there may be restrictions on interest earnings. These limits need to be monitored for compliance with federal tax law and may factor into a determination of when bonds are sold. Key highlights : The PWB adopts resolutions authorizing bond sales and setting policy guidelines for the issuance of its lease revenue bonds, works with the State Treasurer’s Office (STO) in preparing for the bond sale and sizing the bonds, executes key documents, has responsibility for providing certain disclosure information on an initial and continuing basis, and periodically reviews balances in bond fund accounts to determine surplus status. The Department of Finance (Finance) has general powers of fiscal supervision pursuant to Government Code Section 13070, works with STO in preparing Appendix A (the state’s main fiscal disclosure document), may participate in rating agency meetings, prepares fund condition statements as required for the bond sale and for continuing disclosure. In addition, Finance includes appropriations in the Governor’s Budget for lease-revenue rental payments based on calculations prepared in coordination with the STO. The State Controller’s Office and the State Auditor participate in the due diligence process and provide certain financial information necessary for General Fund disclosure in Appendix A. The State Attorney General’s Office also participates in the due diligence process and, together with bond counsel, provides a validity opinion for the issuance of the bonds. During a bond sale, departments provide project time tables, make recommendations to PWB/Finance on bond sizing, participate in due diligence meetings, and keep the PWB, Finance, and STO informed of any events with material impact on the project status or budget. The department manages the facility after construction and it is responsible for obtaining rental interruption, casualty (fire) insurance per facility-lease requirements. The STO is the agent for sale of PWB bonds, with all associated rights and responsibilities including appointment of the underwriter(s), setting the bond sale date, organizing document review meetings and due diligence associated with the sale, securing ratings and bond insurance (if any), and pricing. The STO coordinates continuing disclosure for PWB issues. The PWB’s current practice is to use the STO as a trustee of the PWB bonds and allow the STO to appoint bond counsel and to select a financial advisory services provider related to sales activities.\n\nFiscal information generic to lease-revenue bonds is found in Section 6872. The PWB oversight of lease-revenue projects is described in the portion of this chapter on project administration (Sections 6840–6869). Lease requirements for lease-revenue bonds are described in Section 6872 and in Section 6876 under the heading “financing leases.”"

Agencies/departments will use the uniform coding system to enter transactions consistently to allow uniform accounting, budgeting, and financial reporting. The Governor's Budget, the Budget Act, and the records of the State Controller’s Office (SCO) will utilize the uniform coding system to maintain the central accounting and budgeting accounts for the state and permit a comparison of budgeted to actual disbursements, and estimated to actual receipts.\n\nThe state has statutory provisions that require specific linkage between the accounting and budgeting systems. Government Code section 13344 provides that state agencies/departments shall prepare and maintain financial and accounting data according to the methods and bases provided in regulations, budget letters, and other directives of the Department of Finance. Finance will discuss with the SCO, any significant changes to the financial and accounting methods, unless those changes are specified in law. Finance shall implement procedures that facilitate the annual reconciliation of the General fund and special fund balances between those provided to Finance and the SCO.\n\nAn agency/department which plans to implement FI$Cal, acquires a new accounting system, or redesigns an existing accounting system, after obtaining the necessary approvals specified in SAM section 7260, must ensure the system incorporates the standard codes and structures contained in the state Uniform Codes Manual (UCM), and the departmental program codes and structures contained in the Governor's Budget or otherwise amended per Finance instructions.

Agencies/departments may use lower-level sub-organization codes and structures, provided the system can properly sum to each of the required four-digit legacy organization codes.\n\nFund Codes\n\nA fund code must be used in an agency/department accounting system. The UCM provides alphabetical, numerical, budgetary/legal basis classification and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles basis classification listings of the statewide fund codes.\n\nSubaccounts or subfunds may be established to track lower-level fund or subprogram activities. See SAM section 7450 for a description of the fund accounting policies and detailed information regarding subaccounts and sub-funds.\n\nGeneral Ledger Account Codes\n\nEach general ledger account has been given a unique account code. Agencies/departments requiring accounts not included in the statewide charts of accounts will submit a written request to Finance, Fiscal Systems and Consulting Unit. See SAM Section 7040, Request for FSCU Approval and Fiscal Policy Assistance.\n\nAppropriation Codes\n\nAppropriations represent specific legal authority to expend specified or determinable amounts of money. The codes specific to an organization, reference, fund, and year identify an agency’s/department's unique appropriation. The codes must be identified in the system for reporting to the SCO and Finance.\n\nProgram Codes\n\nThe program coding scheme contained in the UCM must be included in the system. Accountability must be maintained for the program levels displayed in the Governor's Budget. Agencies/departments are encouraged to display program information in the Governor's Budget no lower than the element level unless there are specific requirements to do so.\n\nAgencies/departments may use any internal lower-level program codes and structures desired, provided that the system is capable of properly summing all costs to each of the required program levels."

        "content": "The history of the state’s system of accounting, chart of accounts and fiscal policies spans many years as described below:\n\n1911 The Legislature established the Department of Public Accounting under the State Board of Control charged with the duty of devising and installing a uniform system of accounting and reporting \"to the end that there shall be a general systematic and uniform check upon the receipt and disbursement of public revenues.\" 1921 This duty was transferred to the then newly formed Department of Finance. 1920 The first accounting manual was published. 1951 Substantial changes were made to meet an increasing need for more-comprehensive and more-timely reporting of the state’s financial affairs and the state’s accounting manual was revised and designated as the fiscal affairs section of the State Administrative Manual (SAM). 1959 The chart of General Ledger accounts was devised, and released by Management Memo, which provided greater standardization and integration between the accounts maintained by agencies and those maintained by the State Controller's Office. It also provided greater standardization among agency accounts for Non-Governmental Cost Funds. 1965 The duty of prescribing uniform accounting procedures was transferred to the newly formed Department of General Services. The fiscal affairs section of SAM was revised to incorporate the revised chart of accounts. 1973 Section 13300 was added to the Government Code transferring duties related to the state system of accounting and policies back to Finance. 1978 All state agencies/departments were required to have a fully automated accounting and program cost accounting system. A study of the state's basis of accounting and general ledger was undertaken by Finance. This study resulted in standardizing the accounts to facilitate reporting in automated systems and the restructuring and renaming of the accounts for conformance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 2007 Section 13310 was added to the Government Code requiring Finance to set statewide fiscal and accounting policies and procedures, and provide adequate fiscal and accounting training, advice, and consulting services. 2012 Section 13344 was added to the Government Code requiring Finance to implement procedures that facilitate annual reconciliations of General Fund and special fund balances between those provided by a state agency/department to Finance and to the State Controller’s Office. 2014 A new chart of accounts was deployed as a result of the implementation of the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal) the new statewide accounting system."

        "content": "(Revised and Renumbered from section 7130)\n\nThere are some key differences in the accounting and financial reporting for governments versus commercial business enterprises. Some of the key differences include:\n\nThe purpose of government, which is to provide services to the citizenry, not to make a profit. The users of a government's financial reports which are citizens, their elected representatives, oversight bodies, and creditors.\n\nGovernments are accountable for the management and use of public resources. The majority of government agencies are funded at some level by funds received from various taxes or grants. Because government agencies serve as stewards of taxpayer money, using the money to provide valuable services and goods to the public, there is a need for both uniformity and transparency in the way that financial data is reported.\n\nOther differences between government and business include organizational purpose, sources of revenue, the potential for longevity, relationship with stakeholders, and role of the budget. The purpose of governments is to enhance or maintain the well-being of citizens by providing public services following public policy goals. Taxes and fees are the principal sources of revenue and taxpayers are involuntary resource providers. Governments have the potential for longevity because of their ongoing power to tax and the ongoing need for public services, whereas businesses will go out of existence if they are unable to sustain their operations.\n\nThe Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) sets financial accounting and reporting standards, known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), for state and local government. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) sets standards for public and private companies and non-profit organizations. Both standard-setting bodies receive oversight and administration from the Financial Accounting Foundation.\n\nBudgets are used in governmental accounting as an expression of public policy priorities and a control mechanism by which the citizens and elected officials hold the government’s management financially accountable. A key objective of financial reporting is demonstrating accountability with budget authority. SAM chapter 8300 Budgetary Accounting provides detailed information on the role and importance of budgets, encumbrances, and tracking expenditures.\n\nFund accounting is used for control purposes that are unique to the government environment. The state is legally required to set up funds for certain transactions, as described in SAM chapter 7400 Funds. The state may also set up funds, sub-funds, or subaccounts for internal control and financial reporting purposes. SAM chapter 7400 Funds provides detailed information on the state’s funds, measurement focus, and the basis of accounting."

FI$Cal is a statewide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that maximizes efficiency in the state’s business, implements best practices, limits the number of duplicative systems, provides the ability to produce statewide reports and analysis, and standardizes the state’s business processes.\n\nThe broad functional areas in FI$Cal are listed below.\n\nAccounting Asset Accounting Budgeting Cash Management Cost Accounting Financial Reporting Grant Management Procurement Project Cost Management\n\nFor a description of the FI$Cal business functionality, see the Department of FI$Cal website or contact the FI$Cal Change Management Office at fiscal.cmo@fiscal.ca.gov for additional information regarding FI$Cal functionality.\n\nImplementation of FI$Cal\n\nThe Department of Finance, Department of General Services, the State Controller’s Office, and the State Treasurer’s Office formed a cooperative partnership to develop, implement and utilize FI$Cal, which has replaced the California State Accounting and Reporting System. The Department of FI$Cal is responsible for implementing, onboarding, upgrading, and providing operational support for the system.\n\nEntities Not Using FI$Cal\n\nExcept for specified deferred and exempt entities, all state agencies/departments are required to use FI$Cal.

The requirements of SLAA are codified in Government Code sections 13400-13407.\n\nGovernment Code section 13403 lists the components and elements of an effective system of internal controls. Management is responsible for protecting the state’s assets and for ensuring the integrity and comprehensiveness of the data collected by the accounting system. In order to meet this objective, accounting and fiscal managers must incorporate the elements of a satisfactory system of internal controls which shall include, but are not limited to the following requirements:\n\nA plan of organization that provides segregation of duties appropriate for proper safeguarding of state agency assets. A plan that limits access to state agency assets to authorized personnel who require these assets in the performance of their assigned duties. A system of policies and procedures adequate to provide compliance with applicable laws, criteria, standards, and other requirements.

        "content": "(Revised and Renumbered from 8080 08/2020)\n\nSeparation of duties, also known as segregation of duties, is a fundamental building block of sustainable risk management and an essential component of internal control for agencies/departments. The principle of separation of duties involves assigning different tasks of a process to more than one individual such that no one employee can solely initiate, record, authorize, and reconcile a transaction without the intervention of another. Well designed and implemented separation of duties reduces the risk of fraud and errors, and is essential for safeguarding state assets.\n\nThe State Leadership Accountability Act (Government Code sections 13400–13407 and SAM sections 20060-20080) requires that the head of each agency/department establishes and maintains an effective system of internal control within their agencies/departments. SAM section 20060 provides additional guidance on internal controls.\n\nSeparation of duties, an integral part of internal control, should be clearly defined, assigned, and documented. When designing separation of duties, agency/department heads must ensure that generally no one person will be involved in more than one of the functions listed below for a given transaction. For the purpose of section, members of the same family (domestic partners, children, husband, wife, brother, sister, or individuals living in the same household) are considered one person.\n\nAuthorization – the process of reviewing and approving transactions or operations Custody of assets – the physical control or access to state assets such as cash, checks, supplies and equipment Recording transactions – the process of creating and maintaining records of transactions Reconciliations – the process of verifying the accuracy of transactions posted in the accounting records to ensure that transactions are valid, accurate and complete\n\nThe size and structure of an agency/department unit may impact the extent to which separation of duties is designed and implemented. Agency/department heads should determine the most effective way to implement separation of duties taking the level of risk associated with transactions into consideration. The cost of controls should not exceed their benefits. When separation of duties cannot be effectively implemented due to small size and/or limited staffing, management should find alternatives such as:\n\nIncrease the extent of supervisory review and oversight functions. Rotate duties within the agency/department. Use employees from a different unit other than accounting to assist in appropriate tasks while ensuring there is sufficient separation in the functions performed by these areas. Use an outside service such as Department of General Services, Office of Fiscal Services. Use a larger department within the same agency to perform functions to avoid functional conflicts.\n\nBelow are examples of incompatible duties. No one person will perform more than one of the following types of duties:\n\nReceiving and depositing remittances. Authorizing disbursement. This person will not distribute or route checks for mailing. Preparing checks. This person is to maintain a daily check log. For checks that are signed by a check signing machine, follow SAM section 8081. This person will not distribute or route checks for mailing. Operating a check signing machine. Reconciling check signing count with the checks*. This person should have appropriate authority and responsibility. Reconciling bank accounts* This person can keep original documents, such as general and trust cash receipts, general and trust cash disbursement, revolving fund cash, and invoices. Initiating, or preparing invoices for billing Reconciling transactions\n\n* The employee will not have access to or control the blank check stock."

        "content": "The state’s funds are classified on both a budgetary/legal basis and a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. A fund’s classification determines the basis of accounting, measurement focus, general ledger accounts, and the year-end financial reports required.\n\nThe budgetary/legal basis classification groups funds into two main categories:\n\nGovernmental Cost Funds Funds in this group are used to account for moneys derived from general and special taxes, licenses, fees, or other revenue sources to provide financing for state activities that are the general-purpose (normal costs) of state government. The governmental cost funds group is further broken down into two groups: General Fund: This is the main operating fund of the state. It accounts for transactions related to resources obtained and used for those purposes that are not required to be accounted for in any other fund. Special Funds: Special Funds is a generic term for governmental cost funds other than the General Fund. These funds are used to budget and account for taxes, licenses, and fees restricted for particular activities of the government. Lower level classifications are usually assigned to special funds to associate them with their specific purposes. Non-Governmental Cost Funds Funds in this group are used to budget, record, and report revenues other than general and special taxes, licenses, and fees. Some of the funds in this group are listed below. Bond Funds: Document the receipt and disbursement of general obligation bond proceeds. Bond funds do not account for the liability and the debt retirement created by the sale of general obligation bonds. Depending on the provisions of the bond act, either the General Fund or a sinking fund pays the principal of, and interest on, the general obligation bonds. Trust and Agency Fund – Federal: Used to account for money received in trust from the federal government and the associated program expenditures. All Other Non-Governmental Cost Funds: Other fund classifications within the non-governmental cost funds group include: Trust and Agency Funds – Other, Retirement Funds, Public Service Enterprise Funds, and Working Capital and Revolving Funds."

        "content": "The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis classification divides funds into three fund categories: governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary. The GAAP basis classification assigned to a fund impacts how the fund is displayed in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report .\n\nGovernmental Funds\n\nThese funds are used to record and report the normal resources and costs of the government (i.e., day-to-day operating services). Governmental fund types are presented using the current financial resources measurement focus. Funds in this group are classified into five fund types:\n\nGeneral Fund: This is the main operating fund of the state. It is used to account for all financial resources not accounted for and reported in another fund. Special Revenue Funds: Used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes, other than debt service or capital projects. Capital Project Funds: Used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditure for capital outlays, including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and other capital assets (other than those financed by proprietary and fiduciary funds). Debt Service Funds: Used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditures for principal and interest. Debt service funds should also report financial resources being accumulated for principal and interest maturing in future years (other than those financed by proprietary and fiduciary funds). Permanent Funds: Used to account for and report resources legally restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used to support the reporting government’s programs.\n\nProprietary Funds\n\nThese funds are used to account for activities that receive significant support from fees and charges. Proprietary fund types are accounted for using the economic resources measurement focus. Funds in this group are classified into two fund types:\n\nEnterprise Funds: Used to account for any activity for which a fee is charged to external users for goods or services. Activities are required to be reported as enterprise funds if any one of the following criteria is met:\n\nThe activity is financed with debt that is backed solely by fees and charges. Laws and regulations require fees and charges to be set to recover costs, including capital costs (depreciation or debt service); or There is a pricing policy that fees and charges be set to recover costs, including capital costs (depreciation or debt service).\n\nInternal Service Funds : Used to account for goods or services provided to other agencies, departments, or governments on a cost-reimbursement basis.\n\nFiduciary Funds\n\nThese funds are used to account for assets held in a trustee capacity or as a custodian/agent for individuals, private organizations, and other governments, and cannot be used to support the government’s own programs. Fiduciary fund types are accounted for using the economic resources measurement focus. Funds in this group are classified into four fund types:\n\nPension Trust Funds: Used to account for resources that are required to be held in trust for the members and beneficiaries of defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, other post-employment benefit plans, or other employee benefit plans. Investment Trust Funds: Used to account for the external portion of investment pools and individual investment accounts held in trust. Private-Purpose Trust Funds: Used to account for all other trust arrangements under which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments. Custodial Funds: Used to account for money held by the government as a custodian until distributed to the legal owner/beneficiary."

        "content": "State funds can be created in one of three ways:\n\nBy Statute: A bill passed by the State Legislature and signed into law may create a fund for a specific purpose or various purposes. The legislation will specify the purpose of the fund, the source of revenue, any specific restrictions, the appropriation authority, and a repeal date (if applicable). By Ballot Initiative: A ballot initiative approved by California voters at a general election may create a fund to carry out specific initiative(s) or program(s) that benefit the public. The measure will specify the purpose of the fund, the source of revenue, any specific restrictions, and a repeal date (if applicable). Administratively (Government Code section 13306 (a)): Finance, with the concurrence of the Controller, may create funds used to manage and account for the financial activities and resources of the state through its administrative process. Typical circumstances under which Finance may create funds administratively include the following:\n\nWhen a bill signed into law established a program and identified revenue source for funding the program, but does not include a language specifically creating the fund to account for the activities of the established program, and there is no existing fund that can be used for the purpose of the program. When a fund is created by statute to carry out the activities of a program, which includes distinct subprograms required to be tracked separately, and the law does not include a language creating the subaccounts for tracking the activities of the distinct subprograms. When Finance determines, or a state agency/department requests that it will be more appropriate to separately allocate and track funds to various agencies/departments to ensure accountability and for reconciliation purposes using separate accounts under the main fund.\n\nNote: Although Finance may create a fund through the administrative process, Finance does not have appropriation authority. All appropriations must be authorized by the Legislature.\n\nNumber of Funds and the Process to Establish Funds\n\nPursuant to Government Code section 13306 (a), the general policy is to minimize the number of state funds and establish and maintain only those funds required for sound financial administration. An agency/department with a need for a new fund that is not already created by law must submit a request to their Department of Finance budget analyst with the information listed below. Finance will review and process approved requests for new funds in accordance with Government Code section 13306 (a), and update the Uniform Codes Manual and the Manual of State Funds.\n\nAuthorization/justification for the new fund Identify subfunds (with justification), if applicable Proposed fund title Proposed administering organization Specific statutory reference or legislation (with analysis, if available) Purpose of the fund (nature of expenditures) Source of revenue Proposed period of fund availability Appropriation status (annual, one-time, continuous, etc.) Disposition of any balance upon abolishment of fund\n\nUse of Subaccounts or Subfunds to Track Lower Level Activities\n\nSubaccounts or subfunds may be established to track lower-level fund or subprogram activities.\n\nSubaccounts :\n\nSubaccounts are separate four-digit funds under the hierarchy of existing funds. Subaccounts may be used to track the activities of subprograms separately and may have a fund condition statement. A state agency/department that needs a subaccount must contact Finance to request one under an existing fund (if not created by law).\n\nSubfunds :\n\nSubfunds may be created in a four-digit fund. A subfund number consists of the four-digit main fund number and three-digit distinguishing subfund number. A state agency/department that needs subfunds must contact the State Controller’s Office to request their establishment. All bond funds and special deposit funds are automatically established with subfunds.\n\nNote: The terms used in this SAM section may be used differently in legislation. The general terms and definitions are intended to facilitate communication and share information with the Manual of State Fund users."

        "content": "An existing state fund may be abolished in one of two ways:\n\nAbolishing Funds by Statute A bill that created a fund may set a repeal date for the fund. The fund would be abolished on the date specified in the statute unless a subsequent bill abolishes the fund before or extends the fund beyond the repeal date. If the enabling law does not include a repeal date, a subsequent bill signed into law may abolish an existing state fund. The fund is abolished on the effective date of the bill or on a future date specified in the statute. The legislation may also designate a successor fund for an abolished fund. If so, the assets and liabilities of the abolished fund are transferred to the successor fund. If no successor fund is named, the balance remaining would be transferred according to the provision of Government Code section 16346 . When legislation repeals or abolishes a fund, agencies/departments should track the effective date of the abolishment to ensure all subsequent financial activity occur in the successor fund. Otherwise, transactions posted to the abolished fund will require corrections and could have an impact on the Surplus Money Investment Fund (SMIF) earnings. Abolishing Funds Administratively\n\nA fund established by statute may be abolished administratively by Finance. Government Code section 13306 (b) allows Finance to abolish an existing state fund under the following conditions:\n\nThe fund has had no fund-purpose activity for four years; The concurrence of the State Controller’s Office has been obtained; and Written notification has been sent to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC). The abolition becomes effective 30 days after the date of the JLBC notification.\n\nA fund established administratively by Finance pursuant to Government Code section 13306 (a), may also be abolished by Finance when the fund is no longer necessary to properly manage and account for the financial activities and resources of the state .\n\nIf an abolished fund is subsequently found to be needed, the fund may be reestablished by Finance, with the concurrence of the Controller.\n\nAn a gency/department must work with their departmental budget analyst and the Finance budget analyst to request the abolition of a fund that is no longer needed. A request with the information listed below must be submitted to the Finance budget analyst.\n\nFund number and title Reason/authorization/justification to abolish the fund Specific statutory reference or legislation (with analysis, if available) Proposed abolishment date Requestor’s name and contact information The disposition of remaining balance (if applicable)"

        "content": "Overview\n\nThe Uniform Codes Manual (UCM) contains the state’s uniform codes and structures that provide the level of detail and the framework for budgeting, recording, and reporting financial transactions for the state. Every agency, department, commission, and board within the state government is required to use the statewide uniform codes when preparing and reporting budgeted and actual data. The statewide uniform codes, also known as the statewide uniform chart of accounts, provide details for the following segments: organization/business units, general ledger accounts, program, appropriation, and funds. This chapter will discuss the uniform codes for the general ledger accounts.\n\nClassification of Accounts and Legacy Codes\n\nWith the implementation of the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal), the state redesigned its legacy general ledger account codes by merging the General Ledger codes, Object of Expenditure codes, and Receipt codes into a single general ledger account code segment.\n\nThe Level 1 account is the first digit that categorizes whether the account is an asset, liability, fund balance, revenue, expense, transfer, or statistical account. The Level 2 account is the first two digits that classify a current, noncurrent, or fund balance account.\n\nThe Level 1 account in the legacy code is four digits that end with two zeros.\n\nThe tables below summarize the basic classification of accounts and legacy codes.\n\nAccount Account Category 1 Asset 2 Liability 3 Fund Balance 4 Revenues 5 Expenses 6 Transfers 7,8 Reserved for Future Use 9 Statewide Statistical Accounts\n\nLegacy Account Legacy Account Category 1100 Current Assets 2000 Noncurrent Assets 3000 Current Liabilities 4000 Noncurrent Liabilities 5000 Fund Equity 8000 Sources of Financial Resources 9000 Uses of Financial Resources 9800 Other Financing Sources/Uses\n\nUsage of Accounts and Legacy Codes\n\nStatewide budgeting in Hyperion–Accounts Agency/department accounting in PeopleSoft–Accounts Agency/department year-end reporting to SCO–Legacy codes Deferred/Exempt department accounting/year-end reporting to SCO–Legacy codes Statewide accounting and reporting at SCO-Legacy codes\n\nAll agencies/departments will use the accounts required for its particular fund(s), fund type(s), and financial operations.

        "title": "STRUCTURE OF GENERAL LEDGER ACCOUNTS",
        "content": "Level of Detail for Budgeting, Accounting, and Financial Reporting The legacy general ledger account codes contain four-digits and are structured into three hierarchical reporting levels: Level 1 - Assigned to accounts used to prepare the Controller's Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual Report; Level 1 account numbers end with two zeros (XX00). Level 2 - Assigned to major general ledger accounts which are summarized into Level 1 accounts; Level 2 accounts end with one zero (XXX0). Level 3 - Assigned to sub-accounts to Level 2 accounts; Level 3 account numbers do not end with zeros (XXXX). The Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal) account codes contain one to seven digits and are structured into the following hierarchical reporting levels: Level 1 - Represents the Account Type Level 2 - Represents the Account Sub-Type by high level categories Level 3 - Represents the Account classification. This level may have a 3-digit or 4-digit code. Lower Levels - Represents a further breakdown of the account classification detail or is the Account Detail Code. The 7-digit Account detail code is entered on financial transactions. Agencies/departments must use the appropriate level of detail for budgeting, accounting, and year-end reporting. Agencies/departments may expand the statewide uniform codes to lower-level accounts as necessary to accommodate agency/department-specific requirements. For year-end reporting to the State Controller’s Office (SCO), agencies/departments must use the Level 1 legacy codes listed in the Uniform Codes Manual (UCM). Agencies/departments must be able to report accounting information to the lowest hierarchical level. This reporting requirement does not require agencies/departments to maintain General Ledgers at levels 2 or 3. Instead, agencies/departments can meet the reporting requirements by accounting for the information in subsidiary records/ledgers (e.g., Appropriations Ledger, Revenue Ledger, Accounts Receivable Ledger, etc.) and by maintaining the General Ledger at a more summarized level. For ease of consolidating like-kind accounts for reporting purposes, the same title has, in some cases, been assigned to different account numbers at different account levels. Agencies/departments must use the lowest hierarchical level account number rather than a higher level account number with the same title. This is mostly applicable when using legacy codes. For example, use legacy account 2341 for Equipment rather than legacy account 2340; use legacy account 3010 for Accounts Payable rather than legacy account 3000; use legacy account 3110 for Due to Other Funds or Appropriations rather than legacy account 3100. In FI$Cal, transactions must be posted to the 7-digit account number, the lowest level account. Refer to the Uniform Codes Manual (UCM) for a full listing of general ledger accounts and the hierarchical reporting levels. Subsidiary Fund Information Required for Inter-fund and Intra-fund Transactions Certain general ledger accounts require a fund and/or organization number to identify the other fund involved in an inter-fund and intra-fund transaction.

Reporting errors timely allows the SCO adequate processing time during the year and reduces the backlog of work at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nReport No. 3 consists of the forms below, used to report adjustments to the following accounts:\n\na. Form 576A – Assets and liabilities. The form is required when the adjustment is between funds or appropriations.\n\nb. Form 576B – Revenues, reimbursements, transfers, and expenditures. The form contains preprinted account numbers and titles. Complete the preprinted form to adjust nominal accounts.\n\nAgencies/Departments must submit an attachment (e.g., copy of transaction request, correction letter, etc.) to support the adjusting entries on Report No. 3.

These banks have been authorized by the State Treasurer to receive deposits from departments for credit to the State Treasurer’s demand deposit account at the institution. The purpose of the CTS is to maximize the earning of interest, provide a safe and prudent treasury management, and assure that depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for deposits of state moneys.\n\nAll money in the possession of any agency/department will be deposited in the CTS, except when otherwise authorized by the Department of Finance, statute, or unless deposited directly into the State Treasury.\n\nWhen a deposit is made, the depositing agency/department will notify the STO by submitting a Report of Deposit. Although deposits may be made at any branch of an approved depository, only one demand deposit account is maintained for each depository by the STO. The State Controller's Office (SCO) maintains accountability for all deposits by specific CTS bank account (also known as the agency checking account).\n\nWithdrawals from each agency’s/department’s CTS bank account are made by checks drawn by the agency/department or by the SCO transfers to a state fund. The SCO sends statements of accounts at least monthly to each department with a CTS bank account. The STO maintains the online statewide Agency Paid System for agencies/departments to access and print images of their agency/department checks. The system is updated daily, and check data is retained for five years from the date paid. To obtain access to the Agency Paid System, agencies/departments shall complete the STO’s User ID Assignment/Removal form, STO-IP 130.

Agencies/Departments will not hold any undeposited money for more than five working days. Agencies/Departments may deposit more than once a day when it is economical or practical to do so because of the size of the deposit. Field representatives may either deposit money directly or forward it to the appropriate accounting office to be deposited into a state depository bank in accordance with the agency/department’s field office deposit procedures. However, agencies/departments shall adhere to the SAM requirements governing the depositing of money.\n\nAgencies/Departments should utilize any deposit procedure that expedites the deposit process if the additional earnable interest exceeds the cost of the procedure.

Alterations are generally discovered when the monthly reconciliation of the bank and the centralized State Treasury System accounts is performed. For more information on bank reconciliations, see SAM Sections 7923 and 8060 .\n\nForgery\n\nAgencies/Departments are responsible for reviewing checks for possible fraudulent endorsements. An endorsement is a signature or stamp on the back of a negotiable instrument (e.g., a check). Agencies/Departments will at least test-check endorsements for possible deviations. The purpose of this examination is to determine whether the payee’s name appears as the first endorsement and to attempt to detect fraud. Agencies/Departments shall give attention to deviations from the normal, such as:\n\nEndorsements in similar writing on several checks payable to different payees. The same subsequent endorser on several checks. An agency/department employee is a subsequent endorser. Effacement (erasing or wiping out) of endorsements. Manual endorsements where stamped endorsements would be normal.\n\nAgencies/Departments that detect deviations from the normal shall investigate and notify the OSAE and the State Auditor within 30 days of any indication of fraud or errors determined by their investigation. For information on reporting fraud or errors, see SAM Section 20080.\n\nAgencies/Departments shall send a letter, in duplicate, to the payee requesting acknowledgment of payment if there is a reasonable question concerning the authenticity of the endorsement. If an agency/department has been notified by a payee that a duly issued check has been lost, stolen, or not received, and the check in question is determined to have been paid by the STO, the issuing agency/department will then initiate the following action:\n\nObtain the Forged Endorsement Affidavit form, STO–CA–0034, from the STO, Item Processing Section at ItemProc@Treasurer.ca.gov . Complete section 1 - Description of Warrant/Check. In the “Name of Payee” block, type the name exactly as typed on the check. If initials were used, type the full name in parentheses, if known. For example, if the check is made payable to J. Doe, type “J. Doe (John Doe).” If using a post office box, indicate a street address whenever possible. On the top of the STO–CA–0034, indicate the agency/department address where the payee will return it .\n\nForward three copies of the STO-CA-0034, with a full and legible copy (front and back) of the alleged forged check attached to the top of each copy of the STO-CA-0034 for the payee’s signature. The payee must sign all three copies in ink. The payee’s signature must be either witnessed by two disinterested parties or notarized. Witnesses must sign all three copies; one notarized copy shall suffice. The payee will return all three copies to the agency/department.\n\nThe agency/department’s accounting officer or designee shall review and compare the payee’s signature with the endorsement on the check. Compare the alleged forged endorsement with any other material on file in the payee's handwriting. The agency/department shall, with reasonable justification and proper notice to the payee, refuse acceptance of the forgery affidavit if it is determined beyond reasonable doubt that any statement on the affidavit is perjured.\n\nForward, in triplicate, the acceptable affidavits and copies of the alleged forged check to:\n\nSTO Item Processing Section P.O. Box 942809 Sacramento, CA 94209–0001\n\nUpon receipt by the STO, the first copy of the STO‑CA‑0034 shall be charged back to the applicable bank. The STO shall return the second copy to the agency/department with the charge-back date indicated on the front. The STO shall retain the third copy.\n\nThe bank has 30 days from the date of the charge-back to protest. The STO shall immediately notify agencies/departments of any action by the bank. Reissuance by the agency/department before 30 days from the date of charge-back to the bank is at the agency/department’s own risk. For procedures on handling forged warrants, see SAM Section 8427 ."

Generally, revenues are derived from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, and receipts from the federal government or investment earnings.\n\nGeneral Revenue Recognition Policy\n\nRevenues of governmental funds are recognized on a modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis of accounting, amounts must be earned, measurable, and available. Measurable is the ability to quantify the amount of the revenue and receivable and available means the amount is collectible within the next fiscal year.\n\nGovernment Code section 13302 requires that an agency’s/department’s system of accounting provide, with respect to the General Fund and other governmental funds as follows:\n\nFor the accrual of revenues at year-end if the underlying transaction has occurred as of the last day of the fiscal year, The amount is measurable, and the actual collection will occur either during the current period or after the end of the current period but in time to pay current year-end liabilities.\n\nThe method to record revenues is as follows:\n\nDuring the fiscal year, an agency/department may account for revenues on a cash basis as of the date the remittances are received or amounts transferred from other funds are determined to be earned. Agencies/departments can also record revenue accruals on a monthly basis if it is appropriate to do so as long as it is done consistently, and the accruals at year-end are in accordance with the revenue accrual policies in the State Administrative Manual. At fiscal year-end, agencies/departments will accrue revenue earned whether billed or unbilled, but not collected as of June 30, if they are measurable and estimated to be received within the next fiscal year. Amounts earned but not estimated to be collected within the ensuing fiscal year will be fully deferred and will not be accrued as revenue.\n\nRevenues of proprietary and fiduciary funds are recognized on a full accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis of accounting, amounts must be earned, regardless of when collection occurs. See SAM section 13400 .\n\nRevenue Recognition Criteria-When Cash Received is Considered Earned\n\nUnless otherwise provided, cash received is earned as follows:\n\nFees for an original or renewal registration, license, permit, or certificate are earned upon registration or issuance unless a renewal receipt is issued in a fiscal year which precedes the first day of the renewal year. Agencies/departments will account for the issuance of renewal receipts as follows: Credit the revenue account of the fiscal year in which the renewal receipt is issued if the renewal receipt is issued in the same fiscal year as the renewal year. Credit a revenue collected in advance account if the renewal receipt is issued in a fiscal year which precedes the first day of the renewal year. An application fee, filing fee, or other fees which by law or administrative practice is not subject to refund is earned when the remittance is received.

Amount due is derived from an arithmetical calculation, schedule of fees, or other methods to arrive at the amount. Sufficient documentation exists to support the AR. For example, the agency/department must have the debtor name and an invoice or other document identifying the amount owed.\n\nAccounting for Receivables\n\nAgencies/departments should follow the guidelines below for accounting for ARs:\n\nRecord ARs promptly and accurately within 30 days following the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the AR. For employee payroll ARs, establish procedures for the agency’s/department’s human resources unit to notify the accounting unit within the 30-day guideline for recording ARs. ARs are recorded based on receipt classification and type of debtor. The most common types of receipt classifications are abatements, reimbursements, and revenues. See SAM sections 7620 and 10407 - 10416 for general ledger account descriptions and 10506 for the standard journal entry. Agencies/departments must ensure proper recordkeeping is maintained. All efforts made toward the collection of receivables should be documented to include the dates and types of collection efforts (e.g., letters, offset, phone calls, e-mails). AR source documents (e.g., invoices), and documentation of collection efforts, payments, and any adjustments should be retained for at least four years after the receivable has been paid.\n\nGovernment Code section 16302.2 provides that “Upon approval of the Director of Finance, any state agency with respect to any amount required to be shown on any form prescribed by the agency, or any amount of credit or refund, or any amount to be collected as a deficiency or underpayment of any tax, penalty, interest, license or other fee, or any other payment, may provide by regulation for the disregard of the fractional part of a dollar, unless it amounts to fifty cents ($0.50) or more, in which case it shall be increased to one dollar ($1).” Requests for approval should be sent to Finance, FSCU .\n\nContingent ARs\n\nContingent ARs are those ARs for which there is some uncertainty of the legal obligation but have a prospect of a favorable settlement.

This may occur when either a judgment or settlement is made or the disputed amount has been finalized. Also, it may be appropriate to reclassify an AR to a contingent AR. Such reclassification should be based upon the degree of uncertainty associated with the validity or amount of the AR. The reclassification should not be based solely on a debtor’s action to contest an AR."

A list of collection best practices are provided below:\n\nImpose penalties, late fees, and interest charges as both a preventative and collection tool. The knowledge that agencies/departments can add additional fees may act as a deterrent. When preparing invoices/billing notices, agencies/departments should identify on the invoice/billing notice potential consequences of not paying timely, such as additional fees that may be incurred. Government Code section 16583.1 of the Accounts Receivable Management Act authorizes agencies/departments to impose a reasonable fee, not to exceed the actual costs, to recover the collection costs on a past due account. Utilize the agency/department’s statutory authority, if any, to assess penalties, late fees, or interest on past due accounts. Impose a dishonored check fee. Government Code section 6157 authorizes the state to assess a fee for dishonored checks. Each agency/department determines the fee, not to exceed the actual cost to recover the processing and collection costs. See SAM section 8043.1 , Dishonored Check Charge.

Additionally, agencies/departments can utilize online secure electronic payment systems and local 24-hour drop boxes (e.g. USPS, Fed Ex drop box). Use prepayment as an option when the agency/department provides reimbursable services to another agency/department. The terms of the advance payment must be specified in the reimbursable services contract between the agencies/departments. See SAM section 8453.

Below are collection best practices to use when practical:\n\nObtain identification numbers from customers when possible (e.g., federal identification number, driver’s license number, or other taxpayer identification number). Contact the debtor as soon as the debt is due, but no later than 30 days. Send an invoice and three separate notices of nonpayment (i.e., dunning letters). The agency/department should send the first notice within 30 days of when the receivable arises and the remaining notices at 30-day intervals. Agencies/Departments may send notices at intervals sooner than 30 days if it improves the chances of receiving payment. The notices should include the potential consequences of not paying timely. Consider a payment plan that allows debtors to pay back their debt over time when the debtor is unable to pay in full. Withhold permits/licenses/registrations until outstanding receivables are paid. Offset amounts owed to a debtor by using it to pay outstanding receivables. For information on offset procedures, see SAM Section 8293.4 . Consult with the agency/department legal staff to determine if legal action is appropriate and cost-effective. Consider using private collection agencies to supplement collection efforts if it is more cost-effective than internal collection efforts. Allow debts to be paid through electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards, and other online methods) when feasible.\n\nStatute of Limitations\n\nThe statute of limitations to collect on different types of receivables varies. Agencies/Departments should be aware of the statute of limitations to collect on their specific receivables and monitor outstanding debts to allow sufficient time to conduct thorough collection efforts."

Some agencies/departments may find it necessary to expand these procedures to fit their particular circumstances.\n\nLocating Debtor\n\nWhen the address of the debtor is unknown, agencies/departments will attempt to obtain a current address by using any of the following methods:\n\nUse the internet and/or a data research service. Perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine if procuring services to locate debtors would be cost-beneficial. Request the debtor’s address from the Department of Motor Vehicles by completing a Gov’t Agency Request for Driver License/Identification Record Information form, INF 254. For this alternative, the debtor’s date of birth or driver’s license/identification number is required.\n\nCollection Letters\n\nThree documented letters should be made to collect on non-employee delinquent accounts. However, agencies/departments have the option of making one documented letter before proceeding to the discharge of accountability process for non-employee accounts receivable of $25 and under. This threshold applies to the total amount owed by the debtor, not to each invoice. An agency/department will send a sequence of three collection letters at a minimum of 30-day intervals.\n\nIf a reply or payment is not received within 30 days after sending the first letter, the department will send a second letter.

This last letter will include references to prior letters and will state what further actions, including collection fees, may be taken in the collection process.\n\nCollection Fee\n\nGovernment Code section 16583.1 a llows agencies/departments to charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed the actual costs incurred by the department, to recover the department’s collection costs on past due ARs.

For more offset information, see SAM section 8293.4. Court Settlements—there may be instances where it would be cost-effective for departments to seek court judgments against debtors. Agencies/departments should consider the possibility of filing an action in small claims courts. For larger sums, department counsel should be consulted for advice.\n\nCollection Agencies\n\nAgencies/departments may consider contracting with another department that has a collection unit or with an outside collection agency.\n\nThe State Contracting Manual , the Public Contract Code section applicable to contracts for services, and Government Code section 19130 s hould be reviewed when a department is considering contracting with a collection agency. Any contract made with a collection agency must specify that all funds collected on behalf of an agency/department will be remitted to that department. The collection agency can then be paid in one of several ways for its services - by a set fee per collection, on an hourly basis, or on a percentage basis, in arrears, based on services rendered.\n\nPrior to assigning the debt to a collection agency, agency/departments are required by law to notify the debtor in writing at the address of record that the alleged AR debt will be turned over for private collection unless the debt is paid or appealed within a specified time period. Sale of ARs—Agencies/departments are authorized to sell ARs to private persons or entities. Agencies/departments will record the net income from the sale in their accounting records. Specific accounting entries for the sale of ARs are detailed in SAM section 10536 . Prior to selling the debt, agencies/departments are required by law to notify the debtor in writing, at the address of record, that the alleged AR debt will be turned over for private collection unless the debt is paid or appealed within a specified time period.\n\nAgencies/departments will select the collection actions that are likely to generate the highest net income and do not compromise future state income collections. In addition, agencies/departments should consult with the Franchise Tax Board or any other state agency/department that has successfully established an effective AR collection system to develop methods for improving their collection rate."

Employee overpayments can arise from revolving fund salary and travel advances issued by agencies/departments and payroll warrants issued by the State Controller’s Office (SCO) . For procedures on the recovery of outstanding travel advances, see SAM Section 8116.1 .\n\nFor the purposes of this section, an amount owed to the state by an employee (i.e., an accounts receivable [AR]) is the equivalent of an overpayment. Agencies/Departments should use the following collection procedures, when applicable, to collect ARs due from employees.\n\nAgencies/Departments shall initiate collection efforts (e.g., written notification of overpayment to the employee, withholding amounts owed to the state from an employee’s final separation pay) within three years from the date of overpayment to collect, as provided in these procedures.\n\nEmployee Overpayment Notification: Agencies/Departments shall provide written notification to employees of overpayments. The overpayment notification should include the following items:\n\nAmount due Pay period affected if the overpayment relates to salary Reason for overpayment Response time afforded to the employee prior to collection action Agencies/Departments will give the employee 15 calendar days to respond, orally or in writing. If the employee cannot be reached (e.g., vacation, sick leave, out-of-town assignments), the time afforded to the employee to respond should be adjusted accordingly. Agencies/Departments will document and maintain the employee’s response. Optional: proposed repayment plan and method of collection\n\nEmployee Repayment: Agencies/Departments shall negotiate a repayment plan acceptable to both parties. Repayments may be made by the following:\n\nCash or check Payroll deduction installments to cover at least the same number of pay periods in which the overpayment occurred. When overpayments have continued for more than one year, agencies/departments may require full payment over the period of one year. Payroll deduction to repay overpayments shall not exceed 25 percent of the employee’s net disposable income (i.e., gross minus mandatory deductions) monthly or semi-monthly salary, except from separating employees, as provided below. Mandatory deductions include taxes and garnishment/levy. For a complete listing of mandatory deductions, see the SCO Payroll Procedures Manual . The adjustment of appropriate leave credits or compensating time off, provided that the overpayment involves the accrual or crediting of leave credits (e.g., vacation, annual leave, or holiday) or compensating time off.\n\nAn agreed repayment plan must be in writing and signed by the employee. The signature block will include a statement similar to the following:\n\n“I agree to the repayment schedule described above and acknowledge the gross amount set forth as a legitimate debt owed by me to the state.”\n\nIf the employee does not agree to repay an overpayment or does not respond to the written overpayment notification by the afforded time, agencies/departments will collect overpayments in the manner set forth in the SCO Payroll Procedures Manual.\n\nCollective Bargaining Unit contracts (e.g., Memorandums of Understanding) for represented employees may contain overpayment collection provisions. The provisions of these contracts supersede any other collection procedures. Agencies/Departments should review contracts carefully to identify overpayment collection provisions. For a listing of the contracts, see the California Department of Human Resources we bsite.\n\nSeparating Employees: For separating employees, it may not be possible to provide written notification regarding overpayments. GC section 19838 authorizes the state to withhold an amount sufficient to provide full repayment to the state from an employee’s final separation pay. For information on separating employee salary warrants, see SAM Section 8580.4 .\n\nRevolving Fund Salary Advance in Lieu of an SCO Warrant: These collection procedures do not affect procedures for the collection of revolving fund salary advances in lieu of an SCO warrant when the advance and warrant are in the same pay period. However, if the revolving fund advance is from a different pay period than the SCO warrant, the agency/department must follow the procedures outlined above. For information on salary advances, see SAM Sections 8118 and 8595 .\n\nReplenishment of Revolving Fund for Salary and Travel Advances: If an employee separates from state service and collection efforts are unsuccessful, agencies/departments must replenish their revolving fund for the uncollected advances. To request replenishment, agencies/departments must complete a Claim for Reimbursement form, STD 27A . For information on revolving fund replenishment, see SAM Section 8150.2 .\n\nThese collection procedures do not apply to separated employees (for information on collecting non-employee ARs, see SAM Section 8293.1 ) or collection procedures for Industrial Disability Leave overpayments."

Similarly, when a vendor has both a credit invoice and an overdue receivable, the credit invoice that may otherwise create a refund should be offset by the amount the vendor owes to the agency/department. Franchise Tax Board ( FTB ) Intercept Program Individuals who have outstanding debts to the state may also receive FTB refunds, California State Lottery winnings, or Unclaimed Property. FTB has an Interagency Intercept Collections Program to intercept or “offset” these funds and pay the individuals’ debts to participating departments if departments have a social security number for the debtor. This collection method should be used after three collection letters have not resulted in payment. For more information regarding this program, departments may contact the FTB Interagency Intercept Collections Unit at (916) 845-5344. Offsets Against Payments Among Agencies/Departments The taxing departments (FTB, California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, and the Employment Development Department) regularly offset refunds for outstanding debts among taxing agencies/departments. Non-taxing agencies/departments that become aware that another state agency/department will be issuing payment to a debtor that owes their department should contact the other department to initiate the offset of the payment. The agency/department issuing payment will reduce (offset) the payment by the amount owed to the debtor agency/department. A separate no warrant claim schedule should be submitted for the offset amount to transfer that amount to the debtor agency/department.\n\nOffsets Against Payments to Local Governments\n\nThe State Controller’s Office ( SCO ) allocates money to cities and counties. These payments may be offset in limited situations. The majority of these payments are for specific purposes, for example, highway funds and public safety, and any request to offset these payments must be for the same purpose.

Some off-highway purposes may include farming, construction, landscaping, and utility providers.\n\nThe term “motor vehicle fuel” includes gasoline or similar inflammable liquid which is used in an explosion type of engine, but does not include diesel, kerosene, or liquefied petroleum gas. Gasoline tax refunds will be claimed when substantial quantities of fuel are used in equipment (except boats) of the following two categories:\n\nEquipment not required to be licensed and registered for highway use by the Department of Motor Vehicles such as tractors, aircraft, lawnmowers, farming equipment, and engines used for pumping, air compressing, auxiliary power units, etc. Equipment licensed and registered for highway use but which is substantially used off the highway such as dump trucks, fire trucks, pickups, etc.\n\nThe State Controller’s Office ( SCO ) administers the Gasoline Tax Refund Programs for the State of California. The SCO website provides detailed information on the Program, including guidance, instructions for filing a claim, forms, and excise tax rate/refund rate.\n\nRecords\n\nOriginal fuel purchase invoices must be submitted with the refund claim. The following records will be maintained to support the gasoline tax refund claimed:\n\nAgency issue tags or requisitions for fuel pumped from the agency’s storage tank. These documents will show the date the fuel was placed in the equipment, identification of the equipment, and gallons. Trip tickets and working papers showing calculations based on reasonable data to support quantities of fuel used in motor vehicles operated both on and off the highway. In cases where the fuel is delivered directly into equipment tanks by the vendor, the original invoice will constitute the usage record. Where the fuel is delivered by the vendor in drums or into an agency’s/department’s storage tank, issue tags and trip tickets or calculations are the usage records and will support the applicable original invoice.\n\nRefund Claims\n\nRefunds are calculated at the excise tax rates as specified in Revenue and Taxation Code section 7360 and are updated annually by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. The refund claims are required as follows:\n\nAgencies/departments must use the State Controller’s Form SCGR-1 to file a refund. Agencies/departments may file one claim for each calendar year. However, if during the year the amount of gasoline paid exceeds $750, a claim may be filed at the end of that quarter, rather than waiting for the end of the year. Gasoline tax refund claims will be supported by original invoices. Monthly or other periodic billings covering several purchases will not be accepted in support of the refunds. When a claim for refund of motor vehicle fuel taxes is to be filed, the original invoice will be used to support this claim and a duplicate invoice used to support the claim to pay the vendor’s bill. The duplicate invoice will bear the notation “Original invoice retained for use in filing claim for refund of motor vehicle fuel taxes.” This procedure is acceptable to the State Controller’s Office. The department may prepare a third copy of the invoice for its files. Refund claims must be filed within three years from the date of gasoline purchase. All documents relating to the refund claim will be retained for audit for four years after the refund claim is filed."

The total actual working time per year is determined by deducting the number of hours for Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and other absences from the total hours for the calendar year. To determine other absences, agencies/departments will compile and average absences such as vacation leave, annual leave, personal leave program, sick leave, bereavement leave, informal time off, jury duty leave, military leave, furlough leave, and professional development leave.\n\nThis formula provides billing for actual hours worked. The formula does not include an amount for such costs as identifiable operating expenses incurred in rendering the service, charges for other than incidental use of equipment, overhead, and other costs. In addition, Workers’ Compensation, Industrial Disability, Unemployment Compensation, and Life Insurance benefits are not included in the formula as these expenses can vary substantially among agencies/departments. Such costs should be included in billing for services in accordance with SAM Sections 9211 and 9217.1 .\n\nDESCRIPTION FORMULA NUMBER OF HOURS CALENDAR YEAR 366 days x 8 hours = 2928 hours LESS DEDUCTIONS Saturdays 52 days x 8 hours = 416 hours Sundays 52 days x 8 hours = 416 hours Holidays: New Year’s Day Martin Luther King Jr. Day President’s Day Cesar Chavez Day Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Veterans Day Thanksgiving Day Day After Thanksgiving Christmas Day Personal Holiday 12 days x 8 hours = 96 hours Other Absences (averages)*: Vacation/Annual Leave Personal Leave Program (PLP) Miscellaneous (e.g., Sick, Bereavement, Informal Time Off, Jury Duty, Military, Furlough Off, Professional Development Leave)\n\nSubtotal of Other Absences ____________________ TOTAL DEDUCTIONS ____________________ (Include all amounts calculated under deductions)\n\nTOTAL ACTUAL WORKING TIME PER YEAR (2928 hours less Total Deductions) ____________________\n\n*Statewide data is not available. Each agency/department, based on previous experience and expertise, must compile the information for Other Absences. Remember to calculate a separate average for each type of Other Absences (i.e., average vacation/annual leave, average PLP, and average miscellaneous absences).\n\nSTATE’S STAFF BENEFIT CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGES\n\n(Effective January 1, 2024)\n\nEmployee's Retirement 32.00 OASDI 6.20 Medicare 1.45 Health, Vision, and Dental Benefits 15.69 TOTAL PERCENT 55.34 **\n\n**The staff benefit contribution rate is applicable only to employees who are Miscellaneous Tier 1 members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System. If an employee is not a Miscellaneous Tier 1 member, but is still contributing to OASDI (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) (i.e., Social Security), their appropriate retirement contribution rate will be substituted for the 32.00 percent rate. Those employees who are not Miscellaneous Tier 1 members and do not contribute to OASDI will include their appropriate Medicare and retirement rates and health, vision, and dental benefit rates. For example, the appropriate total rate to be used for members of the Safety Retirement Category who do not contribute to OASDI is:\n\nEmployee's Retirement (State Safety) 22.75 Medicare 1.45 Health, Vision, and Dental Benefits 15.69 TOTAL PERCENT 33.89\n\nAgencies/Departments with employee members in different retirement categories may use a composite employer contribution rate, based on the agency/department’s experience. Agencies/Departments may use other rates for OASDI , M edicare, and health, vision, and dental benefits if more accurate rates can be determined through actual operations.\n\nFORMULA FOR CALCULATING THE HOURLY BILLING RATE:\n\n(Monthly Salary Rate x 1.5534) divided by\n\n(“Total Actual Working Time per Year” divided by 12)\n\nNote: Monthly Salary Rate should be adjusted as necessary to reflect (average) salary reductions for PLPs. FORMULA FOR CALCULATING THE DAILY RATE FOR 2,000 HOURS OR LESS PER YEAR:\n\nThe number of working hours per month is not appropriate for employees not expected to work 2,000 hours per year, less vacation/annual leave and sick leave. In such instances, an estimate of actual working time per month or year, considering average holiday, vacation/annual leave, and sick leave should be used. For example, billing rates for academic year employees, such as college instructors, would be computed based on the number of workdays in a year, less the average of sick leave usage. Holidays and vacation are not considered in this instance since they are considered in determining the number of working days.\n\nDaily Rate = (Annual Salary Rate x 1.5534) divided by\n\n(Working Days per Year - Average Sick Leave Days Used per year)\n\nHourly Rate = Daily Rate divided by 8"

Unless stated otherwise, an appropriation is available for expenditure only during a limited period of time. Appropriations are not interchangeable and must be used only for the particular purpose defined in the act making the appropriation. Appropriations are made by law in the Budget Act, the State Constitution, legislation (for ongoing continuous appropriations) and ballot measures such as bond authorizations. The Budget Act is the predominant method by which appropriations are made. See California Code of Regulations, Title 2, Division 2, Chapter 1, Article 2, Section 613 .\n\nAgency/Department Requirements\n\nEvery agency/department should have in place a system of accounting that provides adequate and effective processes to ensure that:\n\nAppropriations are maintained to the same degree as shown in the Budget Act and constitutional, statutory and other provisions. Agencies/departments, however, may maintain appropriations at the degree necessary to meet their budgetary control requirements. Appropriations are established in their accounting system in the fiscal year in which the funds are appropriated by law. Disbursements and claims for payment are prepared and posted using the proper appropriation codes to identify the authorization for disbursements. Appropriation adjustments (Budget Revisions) and Executive Orders are recorded at the same time as they are recorded in the Controller’s accounts. The appropriation availability period is monitored to determine when the appropriation spending authority expires. The status of each appropriation is monitored and reconciled to the Controller’s records. The State Controller is required to establish separate accounts for each appropriation. At the end of the availability period for liquidation of encumbrances, the unliquidated balance remaining in an appropriation reverts to the unappropriated balance of the fund from which it was made. Unobligated balances of budget authority are carried over and used in the next year when permitted. A uniform appropriation coding structure is used which includes a series of codes:\n\nBusiness Unit (Organization Code in Legacy) Reference code to indicate if the item is a Budget or non-Budget Act item and the category of expenditure (e.g., State Operations, Local Assistance, or Capital Outlay).

Capital outlay appropriations are available for encumbrance and expenditure for three years, unless otherwise specified.\n\nAppropriation availability may be extended for encumbrance and expenditures beyond the limits described in Control Section 1.80 if additional provisions are mentioned in the budget act or comply with GC 16304 allowing sums of money to transfer across fiscal years and /or characters of appropriations.\n\nSection 16304 of Government Code provides:\n\nAn appropriation shall be immediately available for encumbrance or expenditure during the period specified therein, or, if not otherwise limited by law, for three years after the date upon which it first became available for encumbrance or expenditure. An appropriation containing the term “without regard to fiscal years” shall be available for encumbrance from year to year until expended.

        "title": "TYPES OF APPROPRIATION",
        "content": "Agency/department accounting staff should be familiar with the types of appropriations and appropriation terminology to ensure that budget information is properly reflected in the accounting records.\n\nStandard Appropriation\n\nA regular Budget Act appropriation is an authorization for a specific agency/department to make expenditures or create obligations from a specific fund for a specific purpose. It is usually limited in amount and period of time during which the expenditure is to be recognized.\n\nContinuing Appropriation\n\nA multi-year appropriation for a set amount that is available for more than one year.\n\nContinuing appropriations are available for encumbrance during more than one fiscal year (typically capital outlay appropriations or certain items within Control Section 2.00 of the Budget Act containing provisional language allowing for extended availability). For the first year of availability, agencies/departments will record the entire appropriation. At the beginning of each subsequent year that the appropriation is available for encumbrance, agencies/departments may:\n\nRecord the previous year's ending unencumbered balance as the new appropriation.\n\n2. Reverse the previous year's accrued expenditures and accrued accounts payable entry, and\n\n3. Record amounts for encumbrance and reserve for encumbrance equal to the accrued expenditures. The reversal of prior year accruals will create a negative balance (credit) in the expenditures. This negative expenditure balance will equal the unliquidated encumbrance total. This procedure will also make the beginning unencumbered balance equal to the previous year's ending unencumbered balance.\n\nContinuous Appropriation\n\nA multi-year appropriation that is renewed each year without further legislative action. The amount available may be a specific, recurring sum each year; all or a specified portion of the proceeds of specified revenues that have been dedicated permanently to a certain purpose; or, whatever amount is designated for the purpose as determined by formula, e.g., school apportionments. Control Section 30.00 of the annual Budget Act traditionally extends the continuous appropriations for one additional fiscal year.\n\nReappropriation\n\nA reappropriation is the authorization to extend an appropriation’s availability for encumbrance and/or expenditure beyond its set termination date and/or for a new purpose. Reappropriations are typically authorized by statute for one year at a time, but may be for some greater or lesser period. Generally, the purpose of the appropriation remains unchanged.\n\nReverted Appropriation\n\nAn appropriation that reverts to its fund source when the period of availability for expenditures and encumbrances has expired, and it is no longer available for use. Government Code section 16304.1 provides that after reversion, any unpaid encumbrance against the appropriation may be paid from any current appropriations available for the same purposes. For example, a claim against a reverted support appropriation may be paid from a current support appropriation.\n\nCarryover Appropriations\n\nThe balance of appropriations available for expenditure in years subsequent to the year of enactment.\n\nAppropriations not in Budget Act or Executive Orders\n\nAppropriations not contained in the Budget Act and Executive Orders that do not augment an appropriation may be maintained at sufficient detail to meet the requirements of the agency/ department. There are some Non-Governmental Cost Funds that are required to submit annual budgets for approval, and subsequent quarterly budget reports, but that operate out of their own operating funds and do not receive specific appropriations or executive orders. The budgets of these funds are shown in the appendix to the Governor’s Budget but are not included in the Budget Act.\n\nAppropriations may be maintained without a Controller's Journal Entry officially establishing the budget. Some agencies / departments may not be required to submit Budget Revisions or Transfers of Budget Allotment. In those cases, appropriations will be recorded and adjusted by internal documents only.\n\nOther Appropriation Related Processes\n\nAugmentation\n\nAn increase to a previously authorized appropriation. This increase can be authorized by Budget Act provisional language, control sections, or other legislation. Usually, a Budget Revision or an Executive Order is processed to the State Controller’s Office to implement the increase.\n\nBudget Revisions\n\nA Budget Revision (BR) document prepared by the agency/department that cites a legal authority to authorize a change in an appropriation. A BR must be approved by the Department of Finance. Typically, BRs either increase the appropriation or make adjustments to the categories or programs within the appropriation as scheduled. Agencies/departments are permitted to encumber or expend against pending requests to increase appropriation only if the encumbrance or expenditure is made pursuant to an encumbrance document or other written document approved by Finance.\n\nExecutive Order\n\nAn Executive Order (EO) is a budget document issued by Finance requesting the State Controller’s Office to make an adjustment in their accounts. The adjustments are typically authorized by Budget Act provision language, Budget Act control sections, and other statutes. An EO is used when the adjustment makes increases or decreases on a state-wide basis, involves two or more appropriations, or makes certain transfers or loans between funds."

        "title": "ENCUMBRANCES",
        "content": "Purpose\n\nEncumbrances are obligations of all or part of an appropriation. Outstanding encumbrances are the recognition of commitments related to unfulfilled purchase orders or outstanding contracts which will subsequently be recognized as expenditures when goods and services are received.\n\nThe purpose of accounting for encumbrances is to prevent the overspending of an appropriation. Encumbrances reserve a portion of an appropriation representing an obligation that has not been paid, or commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods and services.\n\nAn available appropriation represents the amount of the appropriation that can still be obligated or spent within the availability period allow in the Budget Act. The available appropriation is determined by subtracting actual expenditures and outstanding commitments from the appropriated amount.\n\nEncumbering Method\n\nAppropriations are encumbered by Purchase Orders, purchase estimates (provided the Department of General Services (DGS) Purchase Order is dated prior to the date the appropriation encumbrance availability ceases), printing requisitions, payroll estimates, leases, standard agreements, Public Works Project Authorization and Transfer Requests, encumbrance estimate, or other documents.\n\nAgencies/departments will consider the necessity for encumbering small transactions that comprise a small percentage of total expenditures. For example, individually encumbering small purchases can be time consuming; therefore, the average amount of small purchases outstanding may be included in the encumbrance estimate. (See SAM Section 8342.)\n\nFiscal Year to Which an Encumbrance/Expenditure is Charged\n\nUnless a specific law states otherwise , agencies/departments must apply the provisions of California Code of Regulations, title 2, division 2, chapter 1, Article 2, Section 610 . The California Victim Compensation Board Rule 610 provides that the issue date of an agreement determines the fiscal year appropriation to which the encumbrance /expenditure for goods or services is charged. The issue date of an agreement is the date it is “made and entered into.”\n\nAny required control agency approvals are retroactive to that date. However, agencies/departments must meet the deadlines for submitting procurement documents as specified by the DGS.\n\nFor support and local assistance appropriations, e ncumbrances/expenditures are charged to the fiscal year in which the agreement was issued when the delivery date of the goods/services is in the same fiscal year or the delivery date is interpreted to mean deliver as soon as possible. As soon as possible includes a delivery date that is:\n\nNot identified or specific Specific but not a requested delay in delivery Specified as 10 days, 30 days, or the like\n\nThe following exceptions may apply:\n\nEncumbrances/expenditures are charged to the fiscal year that the goods/services are received when the purchase agreement stipulates that goods/services be delayed until requested or delayed until on or after a specific date (e.g., agreement issued in June for which the agency/department requests equipment maintenance during the next fiscal year). Goods purchased and received in the months of May or June for use during the subsequent fiscal year may be paid from the appropriation for such subsequent fiscal year. Invoices covering such purchases shall be marked as follows: \"Purchased in ___F.Y. for use in ___F.Y.\" Payments for such invoices may not be made until enactment of the subsequent fiscal year budget. Multi-year Agreements – Agreements which span more than one fiscal year may be charged (1) totally to the first year of appropriation covered by the agreement, or (2) to more than one fiscal year's appropriation, depending on the: Appropriation authority – Sufficient spending appropriation authority must exist. Details of the agreement. Agencies/departments will determine the budgetary plan for charging the encumbrance and subsequent expenditure when issuing a multi-year agreement. The budgeted amount will be reflected in the agreement total. Agencies/departments have discretion as to which fiscal year appropriation to charge; however, the budgetary plan is the key factor in making this determination. The certificate of funds availability must be signed by the agency’s/department’s designated approver after ensuring that funds are available. Recording Encumbrances Encumbrances will be recorded in the agency's/department's accounting system. An encumbrance is not recognized as an expenditure when recorded as the items or services have not been received. An encumbrance will increase the unliquidated encumbrance amount and decrease the unencumbered balance. As expenditures are recorded, amounts will be posted to reduce the related encumbrance amount. For partially received orders, many accounting systems will liquidate the encumbrance for the same amount as the expenditure. However, if it is determined that encumbrance amounts are materially misstated, either over or underestimated, adjustments will be recorded to more accurately reflect the expected expenditure. The encumbrance is fully liquidated when the order is fully satisfied. Liquidating Encumbrances Agencies/departments will closely monitor encumbrances to effect prompt delivery of requested goods or services and to ensure timely disencumbrances in instances where it is determined the goods or services will not be received or will cost less than originally estimated. At year-end, agencies/departments should review encumbrances and liquidate reverting year encumbrances. Accounting for Encumbrances at Year-End Agencies/departments will reconcile encumbrance balances to subsidiary reports and supporting documents at least monthly during the year. At year-end, encumbrance balances must be reconciled with supporting procurement and other documents to validate the amount of valid encumbrances and obligations at year-end. Liquidation of encumbrances resulting from year-end accruals of expenditures, and reimbursements will be posted to the applicable appropriations. See SAM sections 10602 and 10608 for accrual procedures. Encumbrances are treated as expenditures under the state’s budgetary basis of accounting and reported as such in the agency's/department’s year-end financial reports and in the Governor’s Budget for most governmental cost funds. Encumbrances and expenditures in the agencies/departments year-end financial reports must be accounted the way they were budgeted. Encumbrances are not included in liabilities or expenditures in the Controller’s Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual Financial Report; encumbrances are reported as a reserve for encumbrance against the fund balance. Note: encumbrances are not classified as expenditures under the GAAP basis of accounting."

        "content": "The manner of recording encumbrances for the operating expense and equipment category varies, depending upon the type of expenditure involved. Explanations below are intended to clarify the manner of accounting for various types of expenditures.\n\nTraveling-in-State or (In-State Travel)\n\nAgencies/departments may encumber at the beginning of each fiscal year an amount equal to their best estimate of the amount of expenses actually incurred as of the end of a month but not reflected on the records because the traveling expense claims either have not been submitted or having been invoiced, but not processed for payment.\n\nUtilities\n\nAgencies/departments may encumber at the beginning of each fiscal year an amount equal to their best estimate of the amount of expenses actually incurred as of the end of a month but not reflected on its records because the bills either have not been received or, having been received, have not been processed for payment.\n\nRent-Building Space\n\nAgencies/departments may encumber, either at the beginning of each fiscal year or on an as-needed basis, an amount equal to commitments made for that fiscal period, as shown on the rental or lease agreement. Encumbrance may be made to reserve funds for renewal of leases containing such an option if the agency/department intends to exercise this right of renewal.\n\nGeneral Expense and all other types of expenditures where commitments are made\n\nAgencies/departments may encumber at the beginning of each fiscal year an estimate of the amount of expenses actually incurred at the end of the month for which specific encumbrance documents have been issued and which are not reflected, due to the delay in receiving invoices and scheduling claims for payment.\n\nAgencies/departments shall encumber estimated expenses for each item or service of $500,000 or greater. However, if the full amount is payable within 90 days the expense does not need to be encumbered.\n\nEstimating Encumbrances While many types of expenditures can be encumbered from purchase estimates, printing estimates, leases, contracts, etc., many cannot. Unencumbered balances of certain appropriations would be over-stated if charges to appropriations were made at the time invoices were filed for payment. For the unencumbered balances shown in accounts and on reports to accurately reflect the true financial condition of the appropriations, agencies/departments may encumber certain types of expenditures at the beginning of each fiscal year. These amounts should represent their best estimates of obligations outstanding as of the end of an average month but not otherwise encumbered by estimates, leases, etc. This estimated amount may be encumbered using an internal departmental requisition, purchase order or other purchasing documentation with the appropriate explanation stated thereon. Agencies/departments will prepare the estimates using internal documentation. The amount of the estimate will vary among appropriations within an agency/department and among agencies/departments depending on promptness in receiving and processing invoices for payment. Agencies/departments will be responsible for determining the proper encumbrance estimate to meet their own circumstances. Agencies/departments will make revisions, as required, based on experience. Agencies/departments that account appropriations on a quarterly basis, for management purposes, may encumber the estimate at the beginning of each quarter and reverse it on the first day of the subsequent quarter. Reversal of the estimate has the effect of disencumbering estimated amounts, thereby increasing unencumbered balances to permit charging invoices to appropriations after the end of the quarter."

All invoices should be processed using the State of California’s standard payment terms unless a discount is offered. Payments should generally be made within 45 days of the receipt date. State agencies/departments shall pay penalties if a correct claim is not submitted to the Controller within 30 calendar days and payment is not issued within 45 calendar days. An invoice is a legally binding agreement showing both parties’ consent to the quoted price and payment conditions (e.g., Net 30, 5% Discount). Invoices provide the following additional benefits:\n\nMaintaining Records - Provides a record of when goods or services were rendered, the recipient, and where and when the goods or services were received. Payment Tracking –Keeps track of payments and amounts owed for both the seller and the buyer. Legal Protection – Provides legal proof of an agreement between the buyer and seller. Receipting – Provides the date, the goods or service received.\n\nRequirements for a Valid Invoice\n\nState agencies/departments should determine that all invoices are valid, correct, and comply with California Code of Regulations, title 2, division 2, chapter 1, article 7, section 677 before submission to the SCO for payment. Agencies/departments will determine that:\n\nInvoices that are not printed on business letterhead shall be signed by the vendor or person furnishing the goods or service. The invoice must be properly itemized with the information listed below. Accurate billing address as stated on the purchase order or contract Supplier Invoice number Invoice date Company name and remittance address Payment terms offered Sales tax and or use tax Goods or services invoiced have been received or provided, as evidenced by stock received reports or similar documents or staff verification.

Invoices comply with provisions of purchase orders, contracts, leases, service agreements, grants, etc. Cash discounts have been taken, if applicable. Authority exists to obtain the goods or services. Freight charges of more than $50 must have supporting prepaid freight bills included in the claim to the SCO. Freight charges of more than $500 have been approved by the Department of General Services (DGS), Transportation Management Unit (TMU) (see SAM section 3852 and State Contracting Manual FI$Cal Chapter 8 Topic 6 8.A6.1 ). All invoices for goods sold to and services provided to the state shall be billed to the State of California or a particular agency/department.

        "content": "Agencies/departments will monitor and review transactions to ensure that claims and vouchers are proper and correct. The internal procedures of an agency/department should be designed to ensure timely, accurate, and cost-effective payment of obligations to vendors. Special attention should be given to the following :\n\nMaking Timely Payments and Monitoring Vendor Due Dates\n\nPayments will be considered timely when an agency/department pays 95 percent or more of its obligations to vendors by the due date. Agencies/departments will maximize effective cash management by paying as close to the due date as workable. Vendor payments will be made by the due date. Due dates for payments are established by the terms of the purchase document, invoice, or contract between the agency / department and vendor(s). If the purchase document or contract is silent concerning terms or there is no written authorizing document, the terms are net 30 days. The 30 days, or other terms, begin upon receipt of the goods or services or a properly completed invoice, whichever is later .\n\nAs prescribed in SAM section 8474 , agencies/departments are required to comply with the California Prompt Payment Act, which requires state agencies/departments to automatically calculate and pay late payments if they fail to make payment by the date required in the Act. See Government Code 927\n\nEvaluating Vendor Discounts\n\nDiscounts offered by vendors are considered in evaluating competitive bids; failure to earn such discounts through prompt payment increases the effective price to the state. Agencies/departments are to pay all obligations in time to take advantage of the maximum discounts offered by vendors.\n\nPartial Payments\n\nWhen agencies/departments accept partial delivery of goods or services without reservation , prompt payment is to be made for the goods or services received upon receipt from the vendor of a properly completed invoice or per the purchase document or contract terms covering the partial delivery.\n\nPrompt Vendor Notifications (Disputes)\n\nPrompt and proper notification to a vendor of receipt of unsatisfactory goods or services or an incorrect invoice defers the due date. The due date is recalculated from the date the problem is resolved. Proper authorization is required when material changes are made.\n\nAlso, state agencies/departments will verify the calculation of discounts, if applicable, price extensions, and sales tax and the arithmetical accuracy of totals on all invoices, including travel expense claims.\n\nDocument Numbers\n\nThe document number providing the purchase authority (e.g., purchase order number, contract number, lease number) will be shown on original invoices submitted to the State Controller’s Office (SCO).\n\nCorrected Invoices\n\nThe agency/department may notify the vendor/claimant of any corrections to invoices by correspondence (e.g., letter, email) which should accompany the remittance advice on manual claims. For FI$Cal vouchers, a message can be added to the remittance advice indicating the correction. Whether the invoice is to be paid by FI$Cal voucher or manual claim, the agency/department must send an Invoice Dispute Notification , STD. 209 , notifying the vendor/claimant within 15 working days from receipt of the invoice, as described in SAM section 8474.1 .\n\nUtility Services Invoices\n\nUtility services invoices may contain a service period that overlaps two calendar months. This billing procedure does not cause any problems except at the end of a fiscal year. For uniformity, agencies/departments will charge utility invoices to the fiscal year in which the majority of the service falls. For example, if the service period is from June 10 through July 9, the total amount of the invoice will be charged to the fiscal year just ended. If the service period is from June 21 through July 20, the total amount of the invoice will be charged to the new fiscal year. If the period of service is of equal duration in each fiscal year, the invoice may be charged to either fiscal year.\n\nDGS Fleet Services Invoices\n\nFleet services are billed by DGS on a calendar month basis. Occasionally minor amounts representing adjustments and delayed billings of the prior year are included in an invoice for the current year. Under these circumstances, the entire invoice may be charged to the current year appropriation .\n\nSubmitting Invoices in FI$Cal\n\nInvoices processed in FI$Cal must be scanned in the PDF format and attached to the related voucher. Invoices cannot be consolidated into one voucher and submitted to SCO for payment request (e.g., many invoices to one voucher). If an invoice is marked as duplicate, it will need to be certified with the language below.\n\nSubmitting Manual Claims\n\nIf invoices are being submitted to the SCO through the manual claim process, the original invoices must be included with claim. If agencies/departments cannot obtain original invoices, the SCO will accept photocopies. Invoices marked as copies will include the same detailed information as provided on the original invoice, such as items purchased, quantity, delivery address, etc. In addition, the copies will be accepted by the SCO only if the following information is placed on the copy:\n\nThis bill has been checked against our records and found to be the original one presented for payment and has not been paid. We have recorded this payment so as to prevent a later duplicate payment.\n\nSigned: ________________________\n\nAccounting Officer"

Details and instructions for the withholding types are as follows:\n\nFederal Backup Withholding Requirements\n\nThe IRC section 3406 states that reportable payments to payees are subject to backup withholding when:\n\nPayee Data Record form STD. 204 has not been completed providing certification of correct TIN and exemption. IRS notifies the agency/department that the payee is subject to backup withholding. IRS notifies agency/department that the payee furnished an incorrect TIN. Payee fails to certify exemption from withholding on interest and dividends per IRC section 3406(d).\n\nComputation of Federal Backup Withholding\n\nFor each payee invoice or similar payment document that is subject to federal backup withholding, the agency/department shall compute the federal backup income tax to be withheld by multiplying the invoice amount by the federal backup withholding rate determined by the IRS. For the current rate and more information, refer to IRS website http://www.irs.gov for IRS Publication 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing and Incorrect Name/TIN(S). Additional resources include IRS Publication 15 , Employer’s Tax Guide, and IRS Publication 17 , Your Federal Income Tax. The computation may be performed on the payee invoice(s) or on a separate computation sheet which should be attached to the invoice(s) and included with the voucher/claim schedule. The net amount (original invoice amount less the withholding amount) is the amount due to the payee.\n\nState Backup Withholding Requirements\n\nPayees who are subject to federal backup withholding are also subject to state backup withholding except for:\n\nPayments of interest and dividends (reported on IRS Forms 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, 1099-OID, and 1099-PATR). Any release of loan funds made by a financial institution in the normal course of business.\n\nThe RTC section 18664 states that reportable payments to payees are subject to state backup withholding at 7 percent. Under circumstances where both backup withholdings and nonresident withholding apply, only backup withholding shall be required. See below for computation.\n\nState Nonresident Income Tax Withholding Requirements\n\nPayments to nonresidents may be subject to withholding at 7 percent. A payee will be considered a nonresident when the nonresident box has been checked on the STD. 204. This form is required to be completed by all payees doing business with any agency/department as described in SAM section 8422.190.\n\nWithholding is not required if:\n\nThe payments to the payee are $1,500 or less for the calendar year. If it is not known whether payments will exceed $1,500 for the calendar year, then withholding is optional at the discretion of the agency/department on the first $1,500 in payments made during the calendar year. The payment is for goods/materials or interest. The services were not performed in California.\n\nThe withholding rate may be reduced or waived by the FTB; however, it is the responsibility of the payee to contact the FTB to request a reduced withholding amount or waiver. If the FTB approves the request, the payee shall provide a copy of FTB’s approval letter to the agency/department for filing with the payee’s STD. 204. Without an approval letter on file, the agency/department must apply the 7 percent withholding rate to the payee’s payment.\n\nThe withholding agency/department should obtain a completed and signed California Form 587 Nonresident Withholding Allocation Worksheet from the nonresident before a payment is made. Form 587 is used to determine if withholding is required and the amount of California source income is subject to withholding. The withholding agency/department must retain Form 587 for a minimum of five years and must provide it to the FTB upon request.\n\nComputation of State Backup and Nonresident Income Tax Withholding\n\nFor each payee invoice or similar payment document that is subject to state backup or nonresident income tax withholding, the agency/department shall compute the tax to be withheld by multiplying the invoice amount by the 7 percent withholding rate (or the FTB approved reduced withholding amount for nonresident payees, if applicable). This computation may be performed on the payee invoice(s) or on a separate computation sheet which should be attached to the invoice(s) and included with the voucher/claim schedule. The net amount (original invoice amount less the withholding amount) is the amount due to the payee.\n\nAgencies/departments are advised to maintain a current copy of the FTB Publication 1017, Resident and Nonresident Withholding Guidelines , for reference in determining the state’s withholding requirements.

        "content": "A Plan of Financial Adjustment (PFA) is a plan proposed by a state agency/department to allocate costs paid from one fund or appropriation to other funds or appropriations. The purpose of a PFA is to eliminate the use of multiple claims for an invoice or payroll charge applicable to more than one fund or appropriation. See SAM section 8452.1 for preparation of a PFA and for requesting a new clearing program. See section 8452.2 for approval of a PFA.\n\nApproved PFAs are used as the authority to transfer expenditures (financial adjustment) between appropriations of the same fund or between appropriations of different funds.\n\nFor example, throughout the month an agency/department will use a disbursing account, such as a clearing program to pay invoices, payroll, and direct transfers that are chargeable to multiple appropriations. The use of a single disbursing/clearing program eliminates the need for multiple claims. Once a month, agencies/departments will submit a transaction request to transfer expenditures from the clearing program in accordance with the approved PFA. The clearing program must be able to support the PFA covered expenditures for the month.\n\nThe clearing program is established in the agency’s/department’s primary appropriation and must be approved by Finance and State Controller’s Office (SCO). Agencies/departments can seek approval to establish a new clearing program by adding language to the PFA letter. See section 8452.1 .\n\nAt month end, the agency/department will perform cost allocation/fund split and record the expenditures in the ultimate funds. The agency/department will provide SCO a written request called the Transaction Request, Form CA 504 to transfer expenditures in accordance with the agency’s/department’s approved PFA authority. Transfers should be for a one month period and months should not be combined. The transaction request should specify whether the transfer is for actual or estimated expenditures. The SCO will process the Transaction Request and issue a journal entry to the agency/department for the financial adjustment.\n\nPFAs will not be used to provide working capital advances, overcome cash flow problems, or distort interest earnings between funds. Generally, financial adjustments are made on a monthly basis but could be more frequent if needed. Transfer of expenditures between funds will be made on an estimated basis when a material interest earnings loss will occur in the fund from which payments are made.\n\nIn accordance with the law and principles of governmental accounting, agencies/departments are required to maintain separate accountability for each fund and/or appropriation covered by the PFA. All PFAs, expenditure transfers, and supporting documentation are subject to audit by the California State Auditor’s Office and SCO, Audits Division."

The DGS State Contracting Manual (SCM) and SAM Chapter 1200-Contracts also provides the provision and exemption information for contracts and interagency agreements between two or more agencies/departments.\n\nWith specific statutory authority, an agency/department may request the State Controller’s Office (SCO) to make the electronic funds transfer payments between the agencies/departments appropriations, see Government Code section 11255 .\n\nAmounts representing advances to the Architecture Revolving Fund, State Highway Account, State Transportation Fund, and Water Resources Revolving Fund will be fully reserved.\n\nInter-Departmental Services Provided by the DGS\n\nThe DGS may provide services, materials, or equipment to state agencies/departments based on interagency agreements. To engage services from the DGS, a state agency/department must establish a Customer Account Number (CAN) in advance. The DGS will use the six-digit numeric CAN code for billing purposes. Information on how to obtain a CAN is available on the DGS-Office of Fiscal Services website.\n\nAdvances to the DGS for Services Provided\n\nAgencies/departments using the DGS’s services will make advances from any fund and appropriation available to assist in financing these services. Per Government Code section 11257 , these advances are at the DGS’s discretion to transfer. The DGS will calculate the advance amount equal to the estimated charges or in an amount determined by the Director of General Services, and the State Controller shall transfer any amounts authorized or determined. See Government Code sections 11256 - 11263 , 11290 , and 11370.4 for more statutory authority regarding advances.\n\nThe DGS Advance and Return Process\n\nNo advances or portions thereof will be returned until the following fiscal year budget has been passed, and all prior year’s invoices have been paid. Agencies/departments will keep subsidiary records by fund, agency, and appropriation to record the original advance amount and the subsequent return of the advance. Agencies/departments may submit a request to the DGS to reduce or return the advance to resolve insufficient cash flow situations. The DGS will submit to the SCO fund transfer requests to return unused prior-year advances and to setup current fiscal year advances. The SCO will issue the following Journal Entries (JEs) for the DGS and agencies/departments to reflect the appropriate transactions in their books.\n\nPrior Fiscal Year Advance Return JEs:\n\nThe DGS and agencies/departments will record the returned advance.\n\nCurrent Fiscal Year Advance JEs:\n\nThe DGS will record the advance as Prepayment from Other Funds or Appropriations in account 2012000 (Legacy account 3120). Agencies/Departments record the advance as Prepayments to Other Funds or Appropriations in account 1309200 (Legacy account 1730).\n\nThe Electronic Fund Transfer Process for DGS Invoices\n\nDGS may bill state agencies/departments using one of two methods:\n\nNon-Direct Transfer – DGS will issue an invoice for goods/services provided. Agencies/departments will process the invoice payment as normal. Direct Transfer – DGS will submit a direct transfer request to SCO for monthly invoices or annual advances against the agency’s/department’s appropriation using the Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) process.\n\nThe DGS uses the EFT system to submit monthly direct transfer requests to the SCO. The EFT system streamlines the invoice payment process and eliminates the need for agencies/departments to prepare and submit claims to the SCO. The EFT process transfers money from the agency’s/department’s appropriation to the DGS.\n\nPer Government Code sections 11258-11260 , the use of Direct Transfer and the Electronic Fund Transfer process is at the DGS’s discretion. Requests for exceptions may be submitted to the DGS and at the DGS’s discretion for approval.\n\nBelow is a summary description of the EFT process:\n\nThe DGS prepares invoices for the prior month’s goods and services provided to agencies/departments. These invoices are available on the DGS -Office of Fiscal Services website after the first week of the following month. Agencies/departments can e-mail the DGS at SRFFiscalServices@dgs.ca.gov and set up an account to view these invoices or inquire about the EFT system. The DGS compiles the Notice of EFT into one electronic file and submits it to the SCO by the 3rd working day of the following month. The SCO audits the EFT file and issues the Notice of Transfer JEs for the fund transfer by the middle of the month. The DGS and agencies/departments reconcile the JEs against the invoices and record the JEs.\n\nRefer to the DGS’s EFT Adjustment Procedure for information on adjustment requests.\n\nDelinquent DGS Invoices\n\nAn invoice is delinquent if it is not paid within 60 days from the date of the invoice unless the total amount due is less than $10 or if the agency/department disputes the invoice ( See Government Code section 926.10 ). If the agency/department refuses to pay the invoice, the DGS will collect payments for the delinquent invoice per Government Code section 11291 . The DGS may submit an EFT request to the SCO, and the SCO will transfer the payment from the agency’s/department’s appropriation.\n\nDisputed DGS Invoices\n\nIf the DGS billed an agency/department for goods and services that were not performed or services that are not in accordance with an interagency agreement, the agency/department should notify the DGS within 60 days of the invoice date. The agency/department shall submit an STD. 209, Invoice Dispute Notification form , directly to the contact information indicated on the invoice. The absence of an interagency agreement does not preclude the payment of valid invoices for goods and services received.\n\nInter-Departmental Services Provided by the Prison Industry Authority\n\nCalifornia Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA ) produces and sells various goods to state agencies/departments. State agencies/departments planning to purchase from CALPIA must complete and submit Purchase Order (STD 65) to CALPIA.\n\nThe CALPIA collects payments through the electronic fund transfer requests submitted to the SCO. The SCO audits the request and issues the Notice of Transfer journal entries for the CALPIA and agencies/departments to reflect the transactions in their books."

        "content": "In order to encourage governments to act rapidly on claims filed with them, Government Code Section 926.10 provides that claimants shall be paid interest on liquidated claims filed with public entities which have not been paid within 60 days. Interest shall be at six percent per year. The code section does not apply to claims filed as follows: Claims of a State agency or fund against another State agency or fund. Claims of the Federal Government. Claims filed pursuant to construction contracts. (Please refer to SAM Section 8473.1) A liquidated claim is a claim which can be determined with exactness from the parties’ agreement or by arithmetical process or application of definite rules of law. For Government Code Section 926.10 to apply there must be no disagreement over the validity of the claim and the claim must be due and payable. Agencies will add interest to claims 60 days after one of the following dates, whichever occurs later: The date goods or services are received. The date the claim is received by the agency. The date of completion of an engineering, legal, post audit, or other review, if required, to determine the validity of questionable claims. A claim is not considered filed until all disputes are settled. Liquidated claims and their related interest charges generally will be paid through the claim schedule process. However, if the amount of the claim is $1,000 or more, agencies may pay the claim by use of a revolving fund check. If the claim is $10,000 or more and a revolving fund check is not prepared, an expedite claim schedule will be used. When preparing claim schedules, an additional five days of interest will be added for a regular claim schedule and two days of interest for an expedite claim schedule to compensate for the State Controller's processing time. Interest paid will be shown on the Remittance Advice as follows: \"Interest pursuant to Government Code Section 926.10\" $ Interest is payable from the same appropriation from which the claim is paid.\n\nIn determining the amount of interest due, the table on 8473 Illustration may be used. The figures shown in the table are the decimal equivalent of interest from the beginning of the year to the dates shown in the columns. For example, interest from the first of the year to July 24 would be the decimal equivalent of 3.370 percent or .03370. Since all interest does not begin to run from the first of the year, interest from the beginning of the year the date interest begins must be subtracted from the date shown in the table. For example, if the date interest begins is March 4 and the date payment is made is June 12, the amount shown in the table for March 4 (.01036) must be subtracted from the amount shown at June 12 (.02679) to arrive at the proper interest factor of .01643 for the period. The amount of the claim is multiplied by this interest factor to determine the interest due.\n\nIf interest runs past December, the interest from the date interest begins to the end of the year is calculated. Then, interest from the beginning of the year to the date interest ceases is added to that. In leap years, one additional day of interest must be calculated when interest periods span February 29. This may be accomplished by adding an additional day to the interest period. See SAM Sections 8474.1 and 8474.4, if applicable.\n\n8473 Illustration (Disclaimer: This illustration is currently unavailable. For access, please contact the SAM Unit at SAMUnit@dgs.ca.gov .)"

        "content": "Whenever an agency/department or the Controller determines a penalty is due, the rate for resource conservation districts, small businesses and nonprofits shall be a rate of 10 percent above the United States Prime Rate on June 30 of the prior fiscal year. The rate for all other businesses including grantees that provide victim services or prevention programs shall be 1 percent above the Pooled Money Investment Account ( PMIA ) daily rate on June 30 of the prior fiscal year, not to exceed 15 percent. The rate for refunds or other payments due to individuals is 1 percent below the PMIA daily rate on June 30 of the prior fiscal year. These rates change annually; therefore, the PMIA rate is communicated to agencies/departments via a Finance Budget Letter (BL). For the latest BL on late payment penalty rates, refer to the Finance website .\n\nThe penalty will be calculated as follows:\n\nStep 1: Determine the Payment Due Date The payment due date is 45 calendar days after receipt of a properly submitted, undisputed invoice, unless otherwise specified in the contract or grant. In the case of refunds, the payment due date is 45 calendar days after notification of the refund to the payee or other payments due to individuals. Step 2: Amount Subject to Penalty The gross amount of the invoice less taxes or the “refund or other payment due” amount. Step 3: Penalty Amount Per Day Multiply the amount subject to penalty (as determined in Step 2) by the applicable daily penalty rate (based on the payment due date) as specified in the BL. Step 4: Number of Days Penalized: Calculate the number of calendar days payment was issued beyond the payment due date (as determined in Step 1). Step 5: Late Payment Penalty Amount Multiply the penalty amount per day (as determined in Step 3) by the number of days penalized (as determined in Step 4). The result is the late payment penalty amount due to the claimant; except that penalty amounts of $10 or less shall not be paid to small businesses, nonprofit and refunds nor other payments due to individuals. For all other businesses, penalty amounts of $100 or less shall not be paid.\n\nFor samples of late payment penalty calculations, see Illustration 1 below.\n\nWhen a late payment penalty is incurred, a completed Penalty Calculation form, STD 208 must be attached to the related invoice submitted to the Controller.\n\nAgencies/Departments shall be responsible for penalties if a correct claim is not submitted to the Controller within 30 calendar days and payment is not issued within 45 calendar days.\n\nFACTS PAYMENT DUE DATE SET FORTH IN CONTRACT AS DEFINED IN SAM 8474.01 PAYMENT DUE DATE NOT SET FORTH IN CONTRACT A Date Agency/Department Receives Invoice 3/1/XX 3/1/XX B Payment Due Date Per Contract 4/1/XX N/A C Payment Issue Date 4/6/XX 4/30/XX STEP Completing Penalty Calculation Form STD 208 – Part A 1 Payment Due Date /1 4/1/XX 3/31/XX Amount subject to penalty /2 $30,000 $30,000 2 Daily Penalty Rate Small Business 0.000363 0.000363 Other Business 0.000034 0.000034 Penalty per day (multiply amount by daily 3 penalty rate as shown in Step 2) Small Business 10.89 10.89 Other Business 1.02 1.02 4 Number of days penalized /3 5 15 Penalty amount 5 (multiply amount by the number of days as shown in Steps 3 & 4) /4 Small Business $10.89 x 5 = $54.45 $10.89 x 15 = $163.35 Other Business $1.02 x 5 = $5.10 $1.02 x 15 = $15.30\n\n1/ The payment date specified in the contract, or 30 calendar days after the date the department receives an undisputed invoice.\n\n2/ Use the current penalty interest factor per day provided annually in a Finance BL.\n\n3/ Count the number of days beyond the payment due date the claim was submitted to the SCO.\n\n4/ Minimum late penalty payments: Small business - $10 / Other business - $100"

The CDTFA website provides detailed information on sales and use tax, including guides, manuals, and forms. Some commonly used CDTFA terms and definitions are:\n\nSales tax is a tax imposed on the retail sale of tangible personal property in California. The retailer of tangible personal property must pay sales tax to the CDTFA, not the purchaser. The retailer may collect reimbursement of the sales tax from the purchaser during retail sales transactions.\n\nUse tax generally applies to the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property in California. Use tax is a companion to the sales tax. Persons, or businesses, generally owe use tax when they use, store, give away, or consume physical products in California if they did not pay California sales tax on their purchase. Use tax may also apply to purchases shipped to a California consumer from another state, including purchases made by mail order, telephone, or the Internet. Use tax generally applies to untaxed purchases from out-of-state sellers. The use tax rate for a California location is the same as the sales tax rate.\n\nA Seller’s Permit must be obtained by every person desiring to engage in business as a seller of tangible personal property, subject to sales tax.\n\nState Government\n\nentities, other than California state and local government entities , are not “persons” for sales and use tax purposes. Sales by and purchases from such governmental entities are not subject to tax. The use of property in California by other states is not taxable. However, sales in California to other states are subject to sales tax. See\n\nCDTFA Sales and Use Taxes: Exemptions and Exclusions publication 61\n\n."

For a detailed description of use tax, see CDTFA’s California Use Tax Information webpage.\n\nWhen to Report Use Tax\n\nAgencies/departments will report and pay California use tax due on purchases from a retailer outside of California whether made by telephone, over the Internet, by mail, or in person if the following criteria apply:\n\nThe seller does not collect California sales or use tax. To determine if sales or use tax is to be reported and remitted to CDTFA, agencies/departments must review the purchase invoice or receipt to verify if the seller added the tax. The agency/department uses, gives away, stores, or consumes the item in California. Report purchases of goods that would have been taxable if purchased from a California retailer.\n\nGenerally, if sales tax would apply to physical merchandise purchased in California, use tax applies when a similar purchase is made without tax from a business located outside the state.\n\nUse tax would be included on purchases of equipment, supplies, and books.\n\nPurchases not subject to use tax include food for human consumption. Also, electronically downloaded software, music, digital books (e-books), mobile applications, and games are not subject to use tax if no tangible storage media (e.g., USB flash drive, DVD, CD-ROM, Secure Digital Card) is obtained. See the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) California Use Tax Information website for more information.\n\nPreparing Use Tax Return\n\nAgencies/departments can file returns online by going to the CDTFA Taxpayer Online Service Portal and selecting File a Return. When permissible, online taxpayer returns\n\ncan be paid by credit card, paper check, or electronic check (ACH Debit).\n\nWhen is the Use Tax due?\n\nThe CDTFA requires agencies/departments to file their sales and use tax return on either a quarterly, calendar year, or fiscal year basis, depending upon the volume of transactions per month generated by the agency/department. CDTFA may apply a late payment penalty charge if an agency/department is late in paying use tax.\n\nForeign Purchases\n\nUse tax is applicable to tangible personal property purchases made outside the United States and brought or shipped into California for storage, use, or other consumption. Examples of items purchased by individuals that are brought or shipped into California for use include artwork, antiques, furniture, jewelry, and clothing. However, there are certain exceptions. Refer to the CDTFA California Use Tax-Foreign Purchases website for additional information.\n\nLocal Sales and Use Taxes\n\nAgencies/departments making sales of tangible personal property are required to report and pay to the CDFTA a one percent uniform local sales tax on sales. If a purchase is made without sales tax from a business located outside the state, the agency/department must report and pay use tax.\n\nAgency District Use Tax\n\nNumerous counties have enacted ordinances establishing special taxing districts that impose sales and use taxes on the sales or purchases of tangible personal property in or for use within the district. Various laws authorize counties to establish districts for transportation, jails, and for other governmental services. See SAM Section 3574.3 .\n\nDistrict sales and use taxes do not apply to fixed price sales contracts executed before the ordinance’s effective date if neither party has the unconditional right to terminate the contract.\n\nAgencies/departments pay the district use tax applicable to purchases in the same manner as prescribed for reporting the state use tax to CDTFA. The district use tax applies to purchases of tangible personal property utilized within the district, but purchased from vendors located outside the district who do not hold certificates of authority to collect use tax.\n\nDistrict Use Tax on Temporary Storage\n\nTransit district use tax does not apply to storing, keeping, retaining, processing, fabricating or manufacturing of tangible personal property for later use solely outside the state or for later use solely outside the district imposing a use tax. The tax does apply when purchases are removed from storage for use within the transit district.\n\nAgency/Department Collection of District Sales Tax\n\nAgencies/departments selling tangible personal property within a district for use within the district will collect the appropriate sales and use taxes from the consumers. Agencies/departments selling and delivering personal property from locations in one county to counties with district taxes are required to report and pay to the CDTFA the transactions and use taxes applicable in the county of delivery.\n\nDelivery charges subject to the state sales tax are also subject to the district transactions tax.\n\nThe tax on tangible personal property sold within the district will consist of the appropriate district transactions tax, the 1 percent uniform local tax, the 1/4 percent county transportation tax, and the state sales tax.\n\nProcedures for Reporting and Remitting Sales and Use Taxes\n\nAgencies/departments reporting and paying the state sales and use taxes to the state-administered uniform local sales, use, and district taxes will apply the procedures in SAM sections 8481-8486. Agencies/departments reporting local tax on sales or property used at multiple locations will allocate the local tax to the places of sales or places of use on the State, Local, and District Consumer Use Tax Return form, CDFTA 401-A For detailed information relating to district taxes, see CDTFA Publication 44 .\n\nAgencies/departments filing invoices for the local use tax due in the same claim as the vendor's invoice to which the tax applies will use Consumer Use Tax Form as prescribed in SAM section 8486 ."

        "content": "(Revised and renumbered from 8731, 8732)\n\nUsually, sales tax and use tax is collected by California retailers and paid to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) on taxable items. When an out-of-state or online retailer does not collect the sales tax on taxable items delivered to California, the purchaser may owe use tax, which is simply a tax on the use, storage, or consumption of personal property in California.\n\nThis section addresses the Consumer Use Tax procedure for agency/department purchases on taxable items where sales tax is not collected. The agency/department must pay the use tax to the CDTFA.\n\nAgencies/departments will identify payments subject to the consumer use tax. Agencies/departments not using FI$Cal will enter an asterisk on the Claim Schedule STD. 218 line immediately to the right of the \"Amount\" column. The agency/department will enter the total net purchase price of all items in the claim subject to use tax will be entered in the box titled “Total Subject to Use Tax.” If the claim is to reimburse an agency’s/department’s revolving fund (Replenishment Claim Schedule, STD. 219TT ), the asterisk will be entered after the applicable item on the calculator machine tape or spreadsheet for revolving fund invoices accompanying the claim.\n\nThe amount of use tax payable will not be included in the total claimed on the Claim Schedule, STD. 218 . Do not increase the vendor’s invoice by the amount of the use tax due. After scheduling the vendor payment, the agency/department will file the CDTFA-401-E , State, Local, and District, Consumer Use Tax Return , online. When scheduling a use tax payment, it is best to have the State Controller’s Office return the warrant and payment voucher to the agency/department through the special handling process. This will ensure that all necessary paperwork is attached and mailed to the CDTFA.\n\nFor use tax payments made through FI$Cal, the agency/department will Submit a regular FI$Cal voucher to the SCO with a special handling request for the warrant to be returned to the agency/department. Upon receipt, the agency/department will mail the warrant and the supporting documents to CDTFA.\n\nFor each claim or voucher containing supplier invoices subject to the use tax, agencies/departments will complete for their files a Consumer Use Tax Return form (CDTFA-401-E) along with a spreadsheet that include the following information:\n\nReporting period Agency/department name Fund code Title of fund State fiscal year Appropriation item number Claim schedule number (if applicable Date Items purchased (brief description) Net purchase price County to which the use tax is due.\n\nAgencies/departments must identify payments subject to use tax. To do so, the agency/department will use reports that provide details of sales or use tax not collected on out of state purchases, in which the seller did not collect sales or use tax.\n\nIn the event of multi-funded purchases that require use tax, the agency/department will submit a separate Consumer Use Tax form for each fund, appropriation, and reporting period. The tax amount due will not be computed by the agency/department or shown on each Consumer Use Tax Return form. The Consumer Use Tax Return form will be retained by the agency/department until a State, Local, and District Consumer Use Tax Return, CDTFA-401-E, is filed online through the CDTFA’s online filing system.\n\nConsumer Use Tax Return forms will be scheduled for payment of use tax to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) by the agency/department simultaneously with the online filing of the State, Local, and District Consumer Use Tax Return (Consumer Use Tax Return), CDTFA–401-E . Agencies/departments not using FI$Cal should do the following:\n\nSubmit a separate claim for each fund and appropriation from which payment will be made. Do not submit copies of the Consumer Use Tax Return form to the CDTFA. Enclose a copy of the confirmation page from the online filing of the Consumer Use Tax Return with the claim and include the payment voucher in a remittance advice envelope. Prepare as an additional enclosure a list of vendors, including name and address, from which frequent purchases are made, which are subject to use tax. Attach duplicate copies of the Consumer Use Tax Return form to the agency’s/department’s copy of the claim. Type or write the claim schedule (if applicable) on the copy of the Consumer Use Tax Return, CDTFA-401-E online confirmation page.\n\nIf more than one Claim Schedule, STD 218 is submitted to pay the total tax due, the Consumer Use Tax Return form, CDTFA-401-E, online confirmation page and payment voucher will be placed in a remittance advice envelope attached to one of the claim schedules. A special mailing request stating, “Please mail warrant in payment of our Claim Schedules numbers , , and , with the payment voucher and confirmation page accompanying claim schedule number ,\" will be attached to the remittance advice envelope accompanying each of the related claim schedules. All claim schedules requesting payment of use tax due relating to the Consumer Use Tax Return form, CDTFA-401-E , will be clipped together and will have a note attached by the agency/department requesting that the Claim Schedules be kept together until audited by the State Controller’s Office.\n\nAgencies/departments using FI$Cal will do the following:\n\nSubmit a regular FI$Cal voucher, which may include multi-funding along with special handling instructions to have the warrant returned to the agency/department.\n\nThe agency/department will attach the payment voucher and the warrant and mail it to the CDTFA."

Legally uninsured agencies/departments (all agencies/departments not covered by workers' compensation insurance policies) will be billed for the benefits paid plus a charge for administrative services of State Fund. The latter charges are allowed under a master agreement for all legally uninsured agencies/departments negotiated by the California Department of Human Resources ( CalHR ) and State Fund. These bills are payable by legally uninsured agencies/departments from the fund or funds from which the injured or deceased employee's salary or wages were payable at the time of injury or death. In case of agencies/departments operating under plans of financial adjustment, \"fund or funds\" above means the fund or funds from which the employee's salary or wages were ultimately payable, as adjusted through the plan of financial adjustment.\n\nThe master agreement mentioned above also provides that each legally uninsured agency/department place a deposit with State Fund.

        "content": "This chapter provides statewide policies, regulations, and procedures on payrolls for state civil service employees. Agency/department human resources offices can provide additional guidance in these areas. Below is the description of the roles of the central service agencies/departments within the payroll processes:\n\nThe State Personnel Board ( SPB ) was established by the California State Constitution to administer the state’s civil service system, which includes a merit-based selection process for hiring state employees and provides direction to agencies/departments through the board’s decisions, rules, and policies. The SPB reviews agency/department personnel practices for compliance with the merit system. The SPB also investigates and resolves alleged violations of the law that are filed by employees, applicants, and members of the public and reviews disciplinary actions brought against state employees. The SPB administrative actions are governed by Article VII of the California Constitution and the State Civil Service Act (Government Code sections 18500-19799 ). These provisions are made more specific by the SPB rules (California Code of Regulations, Title 2, Division 1, Chapter 1 ). The California Department of Human Resources ( CalHR ) is responsible for managing the state's personnel functions and represents the Governor as the \"employer\" in all matters concerning state employer-employee relations. These include all issues related to salaries and benefits, job classifications, civil rights, training, exams, recruitment, and retention. For most employees, many of these matters are determined through the collective bargaining process managed by CalHR. CalHR administers its programs under Government Code sections 19815-19999.7 . These provisions are made more specific by CalHR rules (California Code of Regulations, Title 2, Division 1, Chapter 3 ). For the rank and file employees, these laws and rules may be superseded by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) negotiated under the State Employer–Employee Relations Act. In certain areas, the Human Resources Manual provides detailed guidelines and procedures. The State Controller's Office ( SCO ) is responsible for administering the Uniform State Payroll System and processing all personnel and payroll transactions. Procedural information is available in the SCO's Payroll Procedures Manual and the Personnel Action Manual . See SAM section 8520 for a summary of SCO’s payroll functions. The Department of Finance ( Finance ) approves positions through the budgetary control of salaries and wages coordinated with personnel procedures."

Normal workdays are Monday through Friday, including holidays during the week. If there are more than 22 or fewer than 21 normal workdays in a month, the pay period may end one day before or after the end of the calendar month. On rare occasions the pay period may end two days before the end of the calendar month. The end of the third monthly pay period, in each quarter, will always coincide with the end of the calendar quarter. Annual salary rates are divided among twelve full pay periods of employment. Hourly rate employees will be paid for the same pay periods as prescribed for monthly rate employees. The California Code of Regulations, Title 5 , and the State Controller’s Office’s Payroll Procedure Manual prescribe special procedures for academic-year employees and ten-month academic employees in state universities."

        "title": "TAX WITHHOLDING AND REPORTING - FRINGE BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE BUSINESS\n        EXPENSES",
        "content": "Employment taxes (federal and state income, Social Security, and Medicare) apply to various employer payments, fringe benefits (FB), and employee business expense (EBE) reimbursements. Fringe Benefits Fringe benefits are generally cash, goods, property, or services received from the employer in addition to an employee’s regular pay. Fringe benefits are reportable and taxable income unless expressly excluded by federal and state tax laws, rules, regulations, etc. Employee Business Expense (EBE) Reimbursements Employer reimbursements for EBEs (e.g., moving expenses, long term travel expenses, personal use of state-provided vehicles, uniform allowances, etc.) are taxable and reportable income when the sponsoring employer’s expense reimbursement arrangement does not satisfy all of the Internal Revenue Services ( IRS ) Accountable Plan provisions and any unique requirements applicable per federal and state tax laws, rules, regulations, etc. Accountable Plan Provisions Expenses must be job-related–the expenses would be deductible on an employee’s personal income tax return. The employee must provide, and the sponsoring employer must validate a detailed accounting of the expenses (including time, business purpose, place, and amount supported by receipts). Excess payments must be promptly returned to the employer. Employee business expenses must satisfy other specific requirements. For example, uniforms must satisfy federal and state definitions of what constitutes a uniform as well as be provided under an accountable plan before reimbursements qualify as non-taxable. Employee business expenses reimbursements failing to meet either an accountable plan or other mandated requirements are considered a non-accountable plan and are reportable and taxable income. Tax Withholding Taxation is based upon the actual reimbursement amount. For non-cash benefits such as personal use of a state-provided vehicle, the fair market value is generally used to determine the tax liabilities. The State Controller’s Office ( SCO ) processes applicable tax withholding as follows: Federal Income Tax: 22% State Income Tax: 6.6% Social Security: 6.2% Medicare: 1.45%, an additional 0.9% in excess of $200,000 per calendar year. See Payroll Procedures Manual (PPM) section N171 . Taxes are due (payable) and reportable upon constructive receipt of the EBE reimbursement or the FB by the employee. Employers must report taxable EBE reimbursement and FBs monthly to the SCO no later than the 10 th of the month following the month of receipt. Applicable taxes are withheld from the affected employee’s next regular payroll warrant. For example, taxable overtime meal reimbursements/value of overtime meals received by the employee in March must be reported to the SCO by April 10.

The term capital assets/property is used interchangeably in SAM Chapter 8600 and includes all tangible and intangible assets.\n\nCapitalized Asset: is a capital asset whose estimated useful life and cost to acquire, construct, or improve exceeds a predetermined amount (capitalization threshold). The accounting and reporting for capitalized assets using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting require that costs are not recognized immediately as an expense when incurred. Instead, costs are capitalized (deferred) and allocated over the estimated useful life of the capital asset in the form of depreciation or amortization expense.\n\nCapitalization Threshold: the state’s policy that identifies the estimated useful life, cost requirement, and use a capital asset must meet in order to be capitalized.\n\nLegacy: refers to Uniform Codes Manual accounts or reporting processes that came before the state’s transition to the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal).\n\nNon-Capitalized Asset: assets whose cost to acquire, construct, or improve is below the capitalization threshold.\n\nPersonal Property: are tangible capital assets/property that are moveable, unlike land or buildings. Examples include equipment, vehicles, computers, etc. SAM section 8634 includes intangible assets not related to land and liquid monetary assets such as cash in this definition to administer gifts received by the state.\n\nProperty: see Capital Assets/Property above.\n\nProperty Register: an inventory listing of all property, both capitalized and non-capitalized. The property register will contain the description and cost for each item of property, details of depreciation or amortization expense and accumulated depreciation or amortization.\n\nReal Property:\n\nare tangible capital assets/property that are fixed, principally land, and buildings. Examples include land, buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. SAM section\n\n8634\n\nincludes intangible assets related to land in this definition to administer gifts received by the state."

FI$Cal agencies/departments will perform depreciation/amortization for assets of all funds.\n\nDepreciation/Amortization Method\n\nThe depreciation/amortization method used by the state is the straight-line method with no salvage value of capital assets.\n\nAnnual Depreciation = Cost / Asset Useful Life\n\nThe state uses the modified approach to report the cost of its highway infrastructure assets. See SAM section 8610.6 .\n\nDepreciation/Amortization Requirements\n\nThe following requirements should be followed when recording and reporting depreciation/amortization expense:\n\nDepreciation/amortization begins when an asset is placed in service. Depreciation/amortization ends when an asset is removed from service, or its capitalized cost has been entirely expensed. Source documents supporting the in-service date should be retained and used consistently to maintain a satisfactory system of internal controls as required by the State Leadership Accountability Act. See Government Code sections 13400-13407 . Internally generated intangible assets in progress and internally constructed tangible assets in progress should not be amortized or depreciated. See SAM sections 8635-8636 .\n\nLand, certain infrastructure, certain collections, and certain intangibles have infinite useful lives (inexhaustible) and should not be depreciated/amortized. See SAM sections\n\n8610.1-8615.3\n\n."

Agencies/departments will continue to set estimated useful lives using their existing process for non-governmental funds.\n\nChanges to the useful life of an asset requires recalculation of depreciation/amortization expense for the remainder of the useful life.\n\nUseful Life of Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. The estimated useful life of an intangible asset that arises from contractual or legal rights should be the shorter of the rights or estimated useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nRenewal periods should be considered in determining the estimated useful life of the intangible asset if the agency/department plans to seek a renewal and the anticipated costs of the renewal are nominal in relation to the level of service capacity expected to be obtained through the renewal. Otherwise, the agency/department must account for the renewal as a replacement of the old intangible asset with a new intangible asset.\n\nAn intangible asset should be considered to have an indefinite useful life if there are no legal, contractual, regulatory, technological, or other factors that limit the useful life of the asset. For example, a permanent right-of-way easement is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are classified as non-amortizable."

An improvement that meets the capitalization threshold in SAM section 8602 is required to meet the criteria of this section. The improvement should have an estimated useful life that is representative of the improvement’s longevity. The improvement should be closely associated with the underlying capital asset/property.\n\nAn improvement or betterment adds value to the existing asset. An addition is an extension of an existing structure (i.e., increase to useful space). Added value or increased space is achieved by either:\n\nExtending the estimated useful life of the existing capital asset beyond its original estimated useful life. Increasing the effectiveness or efficiency of an existing capital asset. Substantially improving the quality of output or a reduction in previously assessed operating costs.\n\nFor example:\n\nA building has an estimated useful life of 40 years. A replacement of the HVAC system in year 25 is required. The new HVAC system has an estimated useful life of 25 years. As an integral part of the building, the estimated useful life of the building will be extended 10 years longer than its 40 years estimated useful life. Therefore, capitalization of the HVAC system is appropriate (i.e., extend useful life). Widening a state highway from two lanes to four lanes would significantly increase the effectiveness and efficiency of moving traffic. Therefore, capitalization of infrastructure costs is appropriate (i.e., an increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of an existing asset). A building has operating costs of $10,000 per month for electrical service. Solar panels are installed. The electrical service for one month is reduced to $500. A substantial reduction in operating costs has resulted. Therefore, capitalization of building improvements is appropriate (i.e., substantial reduction in previously assessed operating costs).\n\nSee SAM section 8618.2 , Repairs and Maintenance, for non-capital costs."

In year 5, repairs to electrical wiring in several rooms is required. The cost is greater than $5,000. The repairs will be warrantied for one year. The repairs would not be capitalized because the repairs simply return the building to good working condition and do not extend the building’s initial estimated useful life. A building has an estimated useful life of 40 years. In year 15, replacement of the roof is required to keep the building in good working order. The roof replacement will be warrantied for 15 years at the cost of $200,000. The building would require another roof replacement 10 years before the end of its estimated useful life. The roof replacement would not be capitalized as it does not extend the building’s initial estimated useful life. A vehicle is estimated to have a five-year useful life. In year 4, the vehicle requires a $5,500 transmission replacement. The transmission replacement will return the vehicle to good working condition. The repair should not be capitalized as it does not extend the initial estimated useful life nor improve the efficiency of the vehicle.\n\nSee SAM section 8618.1 , Improvements, for capital costs."

The event or change in circumstance is outside the normal life cycle of the capital asset/property.\n\nAgencies/departments are required to evaluate prominent events or changes in circumstances affecting capital assets/property to determine whether impairment of a capital asset/property has occurred. A prominent event would be conspicuous or known to the agency/department. It would be an event or circumstance that has prompted discussion by the governing board, management, or the media. Absent of any such event or circumstance, agencies/departments are not required to perform additional procedures to identify potential impairment of capital assets/property beyond those already performed as part of their normal operations.\n\nIf a prominent event or change in circumstance has occurred and there is a potential impairment of capital assets/property, please contact the State Controller’s Office, GAAP Reporting Section ( SCO ), for additional instructions. The SCO will help agencies/departments identify whether impairment has occurred, measure the impairment loss, and account for the impairment loss and any insurance recoveries.\n\nMeasuring Impairment\n\nImpaired capital assets/property that will no longer be used by an agency/department should be reported at the lower of net book value or fair value (i.e., additional depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation would be recorded in the year of the impairment to bring the net book value down to the lower fair value of the asset’s current condition).\n\nImpairment losses on capital assets/property that will continue to be used by the agency/department should be measured using one of three methods prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 42 that best reflects the diminished service utility of the capital asset/property. The prescribed methods are:\n\nThe restoration cost approach. The service units approach. The deflated depreciated replacement cost approach.\n\nImpairment losses are generally reported as a direct expenditure to the program that uses the impaired capital assets.\n\nRecording Insurance Recoveries\n\nInsurance recoveries related to impaired assets are reported net of the related loss when the recovery is realized or realizable in the same fiscal year as the loss."

Because the term is 12 months or less and there is no transfer of ownership, no capital asset is recognized and the lease payments are expensed in the period incurred.\n\nLease\n\nA lease is a contract that conveys control of the right to use another entity’s nonfinancial asset (the underlying asset), as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. A lease has a minimum noncancelable contract term greater than 12 months. The asset in a lease contract is the right-to-use lease asset, not the underlying asset.

Statutes specifically provide that such approval is not necessary.\n\nFor example, a donation for the General Fund would identify the purpose of the gift without a specific outcome or requirement to be conditional.\n\nThe Director gives advance approval to accept gifts of money if the only condition of the gift is to specify that it is for an existing fund in the Treasury.\n\nIf agencies/departments need approval to accept a gift of personal property, they will notify their Finance Budget Analyst by letter. The Finance Budget Analyst will either approve or reject the acceptance of the gift.\n\nThe agency/department will record Finance-approved gifts of equipment or real property in the property register and asset accounts.\n\nAgencies/departments will deposit in the Treasury and remit gifts of cash to the fund or appropriation specified by the donor.\n\nIf the money is for a specific purpose, but the donor did not specify a fund or appropriation, and no existing fund fulfills the purpose, the money will be deposited in the Special Deposit Fund.

Record project funding agreements as an encumbrance in the accounting system. Record all project costs and funding transfers as expenditures incurred during the period and accumulate associated CWIP in the asset accounts. Communicate to the Facilities/Business Services Unit when CWIP has been recorded and provide source documentation used to record the costs. The Facilities/Business Services Unit will notify the Accounting Unit when a project reaches occupancy (Certificate of Occupancy) or completion (Notice of Completion), whichever is earliest. A review of all project costs should be reconciled to the CWIP account prior to reclassifying CWIP to a capital asset classification. Report real property to the Statewide Property Inventory ( SPI ) system and reconcile SPI records to the accounting records for real property assets. Real property includes land, buildings (structures), building improvements, and land improvements; whether owned or leased. Certify that on July 1 annually, the agency/department has accurately and completely reported and updated all real property information in the SPI for the prior calendar year. SPI records shall reflect the details and dollar amounts found in the agency/department property register for real property. Do not report CWIP to SPI. Ensure that year-end financial statements reflect all capital assets and CWIP costs. Department of Finance Reviews agency’s/department’s requests for capital outlay project funding through Capital Outlay Budget Change Proposals. Reviews legislation proposing capital outlay projects and capital lease projects. Works with the State Public Works Board and the State Treasurer’s Office to provide interim and long-term financing for projects. State Public Works Board acquires property for the state and approves preliminary plans and reviews performance criteria of capital outlay projects. Department of General Services The Real Estate Services Division (RESD) acts as the project manager for large capital outlay projects for the state. SAM section 6805 identifies eight departments whose purview is outside of RESD. RESD is hired by the agency/department to manage the capital outlay project. RESD is accountable to the agency/department to provide pertinent information needed to record and report all project costs. The DGS will provide access to CWIP reports for agencies/departments to record ongoing project costs. The Asset Management Branch (AMB) administers a centralized inventory system that is the repository for all real property information in the state, whether owned or leased. The AMB may provide an annual inventory subsidiary report of real property recorded in the SPI to the SCO for the preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). State Controller’s Office May compare the real property activity and balances reported in the agency’s/department’s Reports 18 and 19 to prior year information.

May use the SPI and the agency’s/department’s Reports 18 and 19 to support the real property balances reported in the CAFR.\n\nArchitecture Revolving Fund Transfers\n\nAn agency/department can submit a Fund Transfer Request Form to the DGS in one of two ways:\n\na. Customer Requests: Upgraded Information Sharing Environment ( CRUISE ) Request – new projects only; this online form can be found in DGS Global CRUISE system as a required document when the request is for an Architecture Revolving Fund funded project.\n\nb. Directly to the assigned DGS Project Manager overseeing the project – existing projects already in progress.\n\nUpon receipt, the assigned DGS Project Manager reviews the request to ensure all required information has been populated and routes the request to a DGS analyst for processing. The assigned DGS analyst generates the funding agreement and routes it within the DGS for signatures. The DGS routes the original copy to the agency/department for review/approval along with a routing slip. The agency/department signs and routes to Finance for review/signature. Finance signs the original, routes the approved copy to the SCO for processing, and will send an electronic copy of the funding agreement to the recipients on the routing slip. The SCO will issue a journal entry to notify the agency/department and the DGS of completion. The DGS will then key the fund transfer to the Architecture Revolving Fund project shown on the journal entry. The RESD will initiate a Standard Agreement, STD. 213 for projects whose scope will require more than one DGS-RESD Form 22 to transfer funds as needed.\n\nCapital Assets Constructed Using Lease Revenue Bonds\n\nThe State Public Works Board (SPWB), as the lessor, will record project costs that use resources of lease revenue bonds as CWIP until an authority has issued a Certificate of Occupancy or insurance is in place, and lease payments begin. Upon lease inception, SPWB will notify the lessee agency/department in writing of the CWIP amount being transferred from SPWB books to the agency/department books.\n\nThe lessee agency/department will record project costs from all resources as CWIP. The lessee agency/department should accumulate the total CWIP costs, including those transferred from SPWB, and record the capital asset in the fund that will pay the lease payments. The lessee agency/department will record project costs incurred after lease inception as CWIP. When the additional project costs are complete, the agency/department will reclassify CWIP to the appropriate major asset class."

        "content": "The State Controller’s Office (SCO) and the State Treasurer’s Office (STO) perform certain central services for all state agencies/departments. The SCO maintains central accounts for all funds in the State Treasury, including appropriation account balances. The STO provides banking services for all state agencies/departments through the Centralized Treasury System (CTS) and the use of accountability accounts. These interrelated accounting and banking functions of the SCO and the STO require adequate coordination to ensure effective state government operations. State Administrative Manual sections 7320 and 7330 , include summary information related to the broad duties of the SCO and the STO, respectively.\n\nThis chapter provides an overview of the SCO’s responsibilities over the state’s central fund accounts, its’ coordination with agency/department’s accounts, and a description of the Treasurer's CTS management and accountability.\n\nTHE STATE CENTRAL FUND ACCOUNTS\n\nThe State Controller’s Office (SCO) maintains the central fund accounts of the state. During the fiscal year, the SCO posts to the accounts when cash is received, transferred, or disbursed from the fund to keep the accounts on a cash basis and provide the SCO with the following information to the degree applicable for each fund:\n\nCash Investments Appropriation balances Disbursements (by appropriation if the fund is appropriated by specific appropriations) Receipts by source.\n\nThe information ensures that money and, where applicable, specific appropriations for its expenditure exist whenever claims are presented for payment, and to prepare periodic financial reports.\n\nAt the end of the fiscal year, each agency/department operating from a governmental cost fund or a bond fund sends the SCO a Report No. 1, Report of Accruals to Controller's Accounts, for each fund from which it operates. See State Administrative Manual (SAM) Section 7952 for information and illustrations on the preparation of Report No. 1. The SCO’s posting of the accrual reports to the central accounts results in a consolidation of all assets, liabilities, and net position for each governmental cost fund on a modified accrual basis. Refer to SAM Section 7440 for more information about the basis of accounting. This brings the central accounts to the same basis, for reporting purposes, as the agency/department’s detailed accounts as of June 30. In addition to the Report No. 1, agencies/departments will submit required financial reports to the SCO for each fund, at the end of the fiscal year. The SCO will check the balances of the accounts it keeps to the balances of such accounts as shown on these reports and incorporate the data into the annual reports the SCO publishes.\n\nNUMBERING OF CENTRAL FUND ACCOUNTS\n\nThe State Controller’s Office (SCO) uses central account codes to record fund activities. The central accounts are identified by code numbers divided into code fields as shown below:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Fund Agency Year Reference Item Federal Catalog Category Program Account Revenue / Object 4 digits 4 digits 4 digits 6 digits 8 digits 2 digits 10 digits 4 digits 6 digits\n\nFund Number (4 digits + 3 additional digits may be added for sub-fund identification) Agency Code Number (4 digits) Year of Enactment/Fiscal Year (4 digits) Reference Item Number (3 primary digits + 3 additional for reference) Federal Catalog Number (5 primary digits + 3 additional for subsidiary coding) Category (2 digits) Program (2 digits), Element (2 digits), Component (3 digits), and Task (3 digits) Account Code (4 digits) Revenue/Object Code (6 digits)"

        "content": "(Revised and renumbered from 9200)\n\nThis section provides the definition, methodology, and required documentation for the allocation of agency/department costs to their program budgets.\n\nAllocation is the process of assigning and distributing a cost or group of costs to one or more cost objectives in reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship. The process may entail assigning a cost(s) directly to a final cost objective or through one or more intermediate cost objectives. All budgets are required to be in a program appropriation format. Agencies/departments with budgets in a category format must convert traditional line-item costs to the required program budget levels as displayed in the Governor’s Budget. Any budget which remains in a category format must be approved by the Department of Finance . Agencies/departments that receive federal funds should refer to SAM sections 9210-9212 for information regarding Indirect Cost Rate Proposals (ICRPs) or Cost Allocation Plans (CAPs). ICRPs and CAPs identify the methods in which the federal government allows agencies/departments to request and receive federal funds. Costs with one or more characteristics in common are accumulated into cost pools. A cost pool is a grouping of individual costs by an agency/department. Cost pools are then assigned to one or more programs. Costs assigned to a program are either direct or indirect. Refer to SAM section 9213.3 for information regarding time reporting. Direct costs are costs that can easily be identified to a program. Examples of direct costs are personal services for project staff, consultants, travel, and training. Indirect (overhead) costs do not have a direct relationship to the program and are assigned through the use of a formula. Examples of indirect costs are costs for administration and legal units; and unassigned utilities or rent. Personal services and operating expenses and equipment (OE&E) can be either direct or indirect costs. Personal services and OE&E for administration are indirect costs, but personal services for program staff are direct costs. Materials purchased in bulk for agency/department-wide use are typically handled as indirect costs, while materials required for specific projects are charged as direct costs. Some OE&E costs, e.g., telephone costs, may be direct or indirect costs depending upon whether those costs can be assignable to a specific project or program. Some organizational units, e.g., information systems, data processing, and reproduction, etc., provide services to other units in the department. These service units differ from the staff support organizational units (e.g., accounting, budgeting, personnel, etc.) in that they have readily measurable products. Service unit costing is the procedure used to determine the cost per unit of the service rendered. Service unit costs may be direct or indirect, depending on how their costs are allocated.\n\nRegardless of the type of cost, all costs should be allocated according to the most equitable basis practical. In addition, costs should be allocated consistently throughout the fiscal period."

        "content": "(Revised and renumbered from 9202)\n\nIndirect (overhead) costs are incurred for services or activities that benefit one or more programs. Cost allocation is the assignment of indirect (overhead) costs to one or more programs according to a formula. Indirect costs are assigned to the programs they benefit according to a methodology that represents a reasonable and equitable distribution.\n\nThe following should be considered when developing a cost allocation process:\n\nTimeliness—the cost allocation process must produce program cost data on a timely basis. Consistency—the cost identification and distribution methods selected must be applied consistently throughout the accounting period. Accuracy—the information provided shall be as accurate as possible. Auditability—program costs must be fully auditable; e.g., working papers, reports, or system documentation must be retained showing program cost identification, accumulation, and distribution methods.\n\nThere are many ways to distribute indirect costs. Some agencies/departments may use one method for a specific type of cost, while others may use another method for the same type of cost. Below are three of the most common methods of distributing indirect costs.\n\nMethod A distributes indirect costs using a rate that includes personal services or total costs. This method is typically used for distributing administration (personal services and OE&E) and some other OE&E costs.\n\nAdministration costs include all costs for executive staff and staff support organizational units. Examples are executive policy and planning, general administration, budgeting, accounting, personnel, business services, management analysis, training, and legal. Administration costs are distributed to the programs based on the most appropriate method for the work activity.\n\nOE&E indirect costs distributed by method A may include miscellaneous office supplies, postage and printing, equipment rental, telephone charges, and utilities.\n\nThe allocation percentage rate for method A is determined by dividing (1) personal services costs for a program by the total personal services costs for all programs or (2) total costs for a program by total costs for all programs.\n\nFor example, if the share of the Program 10’s personal services is $1,000 out of the $10,000 total personal services cost for all programs, then Program 10’s allocation percentage of the total personal services cost would be 10%. 10% of the indirect costs would be charged to Program 10.\n\nMethod B distributes indirect costs by a rate calculated by hours. This method is typically used for distributing service unit costs. The allocation percentage rate for method B is determined by dividing the total hours required to provide services for a program (Program 10) by the total hours required to provide services for all programs (Programs 10, 20 & 30).\n\nFor example, if a reproduction unit spent 132 hours providing services for Program 10 and a total of 176 hours providing services for all programs, the allocation percentage would be 75%. 75% of the service unit’s costs would be charged to Program 10.\n\nMethod C distributes indirect costs by a rate calculated by usage. This method may be used for distributing rent, telephone, or other utilities using square footage, number of employees, or other equitable distribution base. For each distribution base, an allocation percentage is determined for each organizational unit. The allocation percentage rate for this method is determined by dividing Program 10’s square footage by the total square footage occupied by all programs (Programs 10, 20 & 30).\n\nFor example, if Program 10 staff occupies 10,000 square feet of the total 20,000 square feet of the building, Program 10’s allocation percentage of the space would be 50%. 50% of the rent would be charged to Program 10.\n\nRefer to Illustration 9213.1 for the three methods of distributing costs."

        "content": "(Revised and renumbered from 8753)\n\nCentral service costs are those amounts expended by central service agencies/departments and the Legislature for the overall administration of state government and for providing centralized services to state agencies/departments. These functions are necessary for state operations and are centralized to provide efficient and consistent statewide policy and services. Central service agencies/departments include:\n\nCalifornia State Auditor’s Office California State Library Department of Technology Department of Finance Department of Human Resources Department of Justice Department of FISCal Governor’s Office Department of General Services Legislative Counsel Bureau California State Legislature Office of Administrative Law Governor’s Office of Planning and Research Secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency State Controller’s Office State Personnel Board State Treasurer’s Office\n\nCentral service costs are funded by the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund appropriations made to each central service agency/department. The central services benefit most funds and agencies/departments. For equity, Government Code sections 11270–11275 and 22883 provide for the sharing of central service costs by funds other than the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund. This cost sharing process is titled formally as \"General Administrative Costs\" but is known more commonly as \"Pro Rata.\" See explanation provided in SAM section 9215.1 .\n\nIn addition to administering the Pro Rata central service costs sharing, the Department of Finance, Fiscal Systems and Consulting Unit ( FSCU ), prepares a Statewide Cost Allocation Plan (SWCAP) each year. SWCAP is a cost allocation plan which apportions federally allowable central service costs to agencies/departments. Therefore, differences exist in the central service costs contained in the two plans.\n\nThe central service functions included in Pro Rata and SWCAP are listed below:\n\nCentral Service Plans\n\nCentral Service Function Pro Rata Only SWCAP Only Both Department of Finance: Audits X Budgets X Fiscal Systems and Consulting Unit (FSCU) X Department of Technology X State Controller’s Office: Accounting and Reporting X Audits - Claim Audits X Disbursements X Audits – Field Audits X Personnel/Payroll Services Division and Information Systems Division X State Treasurer’s Office: Investment X Item Processing X Centralized Treasury and Security Management Division and Public Finance Division X Department of FISCal X State Personnel Board X Department of Human Resources (CalHR) X Office of Administrative Law X California State Library X Health Benefits for Annuitants (Retired) X Dental Benefits for Annuitants (Retired) X Health Benefits for Annuitants (Retired CSU) X Secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency X California State Auditor’s Office X Department of General Services Contracted Fiscal Services X Department of Justice: Legal Costs X Tort Liability X California State Legislature X Legislative Counsel Bureau X Governor’s Office X Governor’s Office of Planning and Research X\n\nThe costs of the central services listed above are allocated on the basis of services provided. To do this, FSCU determines the appropriate workload base for each central service. Actual workload units are accumulated for each agency/department. Then, central service costs are charged to the funds on the basis of these workload units."

As mentioned in SAM section 9215 , Pro Rata is the sharing of central service costs by funds other than the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund (CSCRF).\n\nThe cost of each central service is apportioned to agencies/departments. Then, each agency’s/department's total central service costs are allocated to the agency’s/department's funding source(s).\n\nThe Department of Finance (Finance), Fiscal Systems and Consulting Unit (FSCU ) classifies funds as nonbillable or billable. In general, nonbillable funds are those whose funding source is the General Fund or a federal fund. Billable funds are funded by special revenue sources such as fees, licenses, penalties, assessments, etc., unless otherwise exempt by law.\n\nFSCU calculates Pro Rata costs for both nonbillable and billable funds. Pro Rata cost information is provided to departments so that full agency/department costs can be determined. These detailed reports are available in the Finance Accounting Pro Rata Library .\n\nFull cost information is particularly important when nonbillable funding sources provide and recover full costs for reimbursable services; this helps to ensure that billable funding sources are not unfairly recovering for nonbillable funding sources. See SAM section 9212 for more information on the state's full cost recovery process.\n\nFinance certifies to the State Controller’s Office ( SCO ) the Pro Rata costs to be assessed against billable funds. The Pro Rata assessments against billable funds are processed by the SCO transfers. The transfers are first made to the CSCRF up to the amount determined by FSCU. All subsequent transfers for that fiscal year are made to the General Fund.\n\nFor questions concerning Pro Rata, contact the FSCU Pro Rata analyst at fiproswp@dof.ca.gov ."

Assume total direct costs incurred for Department ABC’s reimbursable activity during the billing period to be $350,000, of which $250,000 is for direct personal services costs and $100,000 is for other direct operating costs.\n\n4.

All federal money received directly from the federal government must be deposited in the Federal Trust Fund with exceptions such as contracts and equitable sharing program as described below.\n\nGrants and Cooperative Agreements\n\nThe state may enter into grants and cooperative agreements with the federal government. The federal agency will transfer money, property, services, or anything of value to the state to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by federal statute.\n\nGrants and cooperative agreements should have a valid Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number .\n\nMoney received directly from the federal government for a grant or cooperative agreement must be deposited in the Federal Trust Fund.\n\nContracts\n\nThe state may enter into procurement contracts with the federal government to acquire, purchase, lease, or barter property or services for the direct benefit or use of the federal government. Money received under federal procurement contracts will not be deposited in the Federal Trust Fund.\n\nEquitable Sharing Program\n\nThe state may participate in the federal program to share federal asset forfeiture proceeds through equitable sharing. Money received under such a program will not be deposited in the Federal Trust Fund. For example, asset forfeiture proceeds from the federal government must be maintained in a separate fund or account subject to appropriate accounting controls and financial audits. Money received under such a program will not be deposited in the Federal Trust Fund.\n\nOther Exceptions\n\nRevenues derived from sources of financing other than receipts from the federal government should not be deposited in the Federal Trust Fund. For example, revenues derived from taxes, licenses, fees, and fines.\n\nMoney received directly from the federal government will be classified as federal funds. However, federal assistance money passed from one state agency/department to another will be classified by the receiving agency/department as reimbursements.\n\nRefer to SAM section 8003 , Receipt of Federal Funds, and sections 8010 through 8014 on the Cash Management Improvement Act for information on the exchange of funds between the state and the federal government. The funds received by the state are subject to the federal administrative and legal requirements, audit requirements, and federal cost principles.

To assure its independence, the State Auditor is free from the control of the executive and legislative branches. A state commission oversees its administrative operations. The State Auditor performs an annual audit of the state's financial statements prepared by the Controller and the annual audit of the federal funds (Single Audit) compiled by Finance. The State Auditor also conducts financial and performance audits as directed by statute, and other government audits requested by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. The State Auditor has the explicit authority to audit any agency that receives state funds. Consequently, it sometimes audits at the local government level. In addition, the State Auditor administers the \"California Whistleblower Protection Act,” which includes a hotline for anonymous reporting.\n\nCALIFORNIA STATE CONTROLLER’S OFFICE\n\nThe primary function of the Controller is to provide sound fiscal control over both receipts and disbursements of public funds and to report periodically on the financial operations and condition of both state and local government. Consequently, the Controller performs financial audits and financial related audits of federal and state funds, and audits state agencies’ payroll procedures in connection with the Controller's central disbursing function. Additionally, the Controller performs audits under contract for state and federal agencies and reviews single audit activities of local government and K-12 school districts.\n\nThe Controller also provides pre-audits and post-audits of claims for payment as part of the state's central disbursement function. The Controller functions in a coordinating role for Auditor/Controllers at the local government level."

        "content": "To prevent duplication of the annual financial audit conducted by the State Auditor, GC 8546.4(e) prescribes that except for those state agencies that are required by state law to obtain an annual audit, no state agency shall encumber funds appropriated by the Legislature for the purpose of funding annual financial audits that may be covered by the single audit performed by the State Auditor. In addition, GC 8546.4(e) states that no state agency shall enter into a contract for a financial or compliance audit without prior written approval of Finance and the Controller. INTERNAL AUDIT COORDINATION GC 13071 assigns Finance the primary responsibility of coordinating state internal audit activities. This coordination will not affect audit activities that are an integral part of an agency’s functions, such as regulatory and tax auditors, or other auditors who work directly with selected industries or taxpayers. Finance also issues Audit Memos. These memos may establish uniform policies, interpretations, procedures or technical requirements, or provide advice or information. Copies are available from Finance’s OSAE, or electronically on the Finance website . In addition, Finance may coordinate the implementation of internal audit standards by conducting quality assurance reviews of internal audit units. See SAM section 20050 for Quality Assurance Reviews of the state’s internal audit units to determine their compliance with appropriate audit standards. SINGLE AUDIT COORDINATION Pursuant to the Single Audit Act, the OMB’s Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (commonly called “Uniform Guidance”) was officially implemented in December 2014. The Uniform Guidance, which is a government-wide framework for federal awards/grants management, supersedes guidance from earlier OMB Circulars including OMB A-133. See SAM section 20030 for new requirements under the Uniform Guidance. The Single Audit Act and Uniform Guidance establish standards for the expenditure and audit of federal funds. At the state level, California meets the federal audit requirements through the State Auditor’s annual single audit of the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA). The Single Audit also includes an audit of federal programs for compliance with federal laws and regulations, and recommendations to improve the state’s financial systems and internal control. Finance serves as the federal audit liaison and coordinates and carries out responsibilities related to the Single Audit Act. These responsibilities include:\n\nCompiling information received from state agencies for inclusion in the SEFA. Compiling individual entity management representation letters into a single representation letter signed by the Director of Finance and submitted to the State Auditor, as required in SAM 20080, Notification of Fraud or Error, Single Audit Notification. Coordinating state agency corrective action plans specific to prior year audit findings. Submitting the Single Audit Report to the federal government.\n\nSee the Single Audit page on Finance’s website for guidance.\n\nThe Controller serves as the single audit oversight agency for most California local governments. Additionally, the Controller submits an audit inquiry letter to the Attorney General requesting information on pending or threatened litigation. This information is provided directly to the State Auditor as part of the single audit process."

GC 1237 requires state agencies with aggregate annual spending of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) or more annually consider establishing an internal audit unit. OSAE maintains a list of internal audit organizations . These organizations provide objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and improve the agency’s operations. The internal audit organization helps an agency accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal control processes.\n\nInternal auditors of state agencies shall utilize the “International Standards for the Professional Practices of Internal Auditing (Standards)” ( GC 13071 ) or the Government Auditing Standards as issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (GC 13886.5). Standards require that internal audit organizations develop and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the internal audit organization."

        "title": "AUDIT STANDARDS",
        "content": "(Revised and Renumbered 12/2017) Various organizations promulgate audit standards for auditors to follow. Standards are designed to enhance the quality and consistency of audits and audit reports. GC 13886.5 specifies that all state agencies that have their own internal auditors or that conduct internal audit activities shall conduct internal audit activity under the general and specified standards of internal auditing prescribed by the Institute of Internal Auditors or the Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, as appropriate. In addition, auditors are required to adhere to other generally accepted audit standards whenever applicable, such as the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS The Institute of Internal Auditors promulgates standards for internal auditors in a publication titled International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (Standards) known as the “Red Book .” These standards are principle-focused and provide a framework for performing and promoting internal auditing. The Standards are mandatory requirements consisting of statements of basic requirements for the professional practice of internal auditing and for evaluating the effectiveness of its performance. Additionally, management must ensure that the internal audit organization is independent of the activities and programs it audits. GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS The Comptroller General of the United States issued the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards , known as the “Yellow Book,” to provide a framework for conducting high quality audits with competence, integrity, objectivity, and independence. The Yellow Book is for use by auditors of government agencies, agencies that receive government awards, and other audit organizations performing Yellow Book audits. GENERALLY ACCEPTED AUDITING STANDARDS The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants requires adherence to Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) for external audits of financial statements as codified in GAAS and in interpretations of those standards. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements supplement these standards. Together, these standards provide a general framework and guidelines when performing various audits from an external audit perspective . QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEWS Standards require an external quality assurance review every five years and Yellow Book requires an external peer review every three years. Consistent with GC 13071 , Finance may perform quality assurance reviews of the state’s internal audit units to determine their compliance with appropriate audit standards. The reviews result in reports containing an opinion that the internal audit unit fully complies, adequately complies, or does not comply with the required standards."

        "title": "INTERNAL CONTROL",
        "content": "INTERNAL CONTROL DEFINED Internal control is defined as a process effected by an entity’s oversight body, management, and other personnel that provides reasonable assurance that the objectives of an entity will be achieved. These objectives and related risks of not achieving those objectives can be broadly classified into one or more of the following three categories: Effectiveness and efficiency of operations Reliability of reporting for internal and external use Compliance with applicable laws and regulations This definition is from the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Green Book) by the Comptroller General of the United States. The Green Book provides the overall framework for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control system . The State of California has adopted the Green Book as a framework for an internal control system. The Green Book adapted internal control principals from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s (COSO) published Internal Control - Integrated Framework which establishes five principals related to basic components of internal control. The five components of internal control are listed below in the SLAA section. SLAA defines internal control in a manner similar to the Green Book. SLAA defines internal control as a process, including a continuous built-in component of operations, effected by a state agency’s oversight body, management, and other personnel that provide reasonable assurance that the state agency’s objectives will be achieved. Further state internal audit organizations may be familiar with another definition of internal control as defined in the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (Standards) , issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). IIA defines internal control as any action taken by management, the board, and other parties to manage risk and increase the likelihood that established objectives and goals will be achieved. STATE LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY ACT State agency heads, by reason of their appointments, are accountable for activities carried out in their agency. This responsibility includes the establishment and maintenance of a system of internal control, and effective and objective ongoing monitoring of the internal controls within the agency. Such responsibility also includes documenting the system, communicating system requirements to employees, and ensuring that the system is functioning as intended and is modified, as appropriate, for changes in conditions. Because governments are susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse, increased attention has been directed toward strengthening internal control to help restore confidence in government and improve its operations. As a result, SLAA 1 was enacted in 1983 to inhibit waste of resources, create savings, and enhance public accountability. SLAA is codified in GC 13400 through 13407 , which describes the legislative findings, agency responsibility, internal controls, and reporting on the adequacy of internal control and ongoing monitoring. All levels of management must be involved in assessing and strengthening the systems of internal control to minimize fraud, errors, abuse, and waste of government funds. GC 13403 defines internal control and sets forth the elements of a satisfactory system of internal control. It also emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and agency head responsibilities. As stated in GC 13403, internal controls provide reasonable assurance that the agency objectives will be achieved. To constitute an effective internal control system, the state agency needs to effectively design, implement, and operate the five components of internal control in an integrated manner. The five components of internal control include the following: Control Environment . The foundation for an internal control system that provides the discipline and structure to help an agency achieve its objectives. Risk Assessment . An assessment of the risks facing the agency as it seeks to achieve its objectives and provides the basis for developing appropriate risk responses. Control Activities . The actions management establishes through policies and procedures to achieve objectives and respond to risks in the internal control system. Information and Communication . The quality of vital information used and communicated to achieve the agency’s objectives. Monitoring . Activities management establishes and operates to assess the quality of performance over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. GC 13403 states the elements of a satisfactory system of internal control shall include, but are not limited to: A plan of organization that provides segregation of duties appropriate for proper safeguarding of state agency assets. A plan that limits access to state agency assets to authorized personnel who require these assets in the performance of their assigned duties. A system of policies and procedures adequate to provide compliance with applicable laws, criteria, standards, and other requirements. An established system of practices to be followed in performance of duties and functions in each of the state agencies. Personnel of a quality commensurate with their responsibilities. An effective system of internal review. A technology infrastructure to support the completeness, accuracy, and validity of information processed. These elements, as important as each is in its own right, are expected to be mutually reinforcing and, thus, to provide the system with “internal checks and balances.” All the elements are so basic to adequate internal control that serious deficiencies in any one could preclude effective operation of the system and signal a problem. Another vital aspect of an internal control system is the ongoing monitoring of the system. Ongoing monitoring ensures management possesses the information to assess whether the: system is functioning as intended, controls remain effective, control weaknesses are corrected timely, and information is accurate and reliable. SYMPTOMS OF CONTROL DEFICIENCIES Experience has indicated that the existence of one or more of the following situations are usually indicative of a poorly maintained or vulnerable control system. These situations may apply to the organization as a whole or to individual units or activities. Agency heads and managers must identify and make the necessary corrections if any of the situations listed below exist within their organization and/or a similar situation of equal gravity.\n\nPolicy and procedural or operational manuals are not current or are nonexistent. Lines of organizational authority and responsibility are not clearly articulated or are nonexistent. Financial and operational reporting is not timely and is not used as an effective management tool. Management and line supervisors ignore or do not adequately monitor control compliance. Operation controls are not regularly evaluated for effectiveness. Identified internal control weaknesses are not corrected timely. Controls and/or control evaluations bear little relationship to organizational exposure to loss.\n\n1 Formerly the Financial Integrity and State Manager’s Accountability Act of 1983 (FISMA)."
